## Summary

This proposal suggests increasing the ledger-wide read byte limits which is a bottleneck for existing protocols. 

## Goals Alignment

Increasing the limit will support existing protocols to operate at acale, faciliating efficient and scalable everyday financial services.

## Limit Change Rationale

### Ledger read bytes limt

Soroban is often in surge pricing (20%-40% of Ledgers, Early February 2025) and the only resource getting exhausted is the read bytes.

Examining a simple [SoroSwap invocation](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/238820179026497536#238820179026497537) reveals that 64kb are read, mostly due to reading WASM (two contracts in this instance). With the current ledger limit of 500kb this amounts to a theoretical limit of 7 swaps per ledger. Other ledger wide limits (read entries, write entries, instructions, ledger write bytes) allow for more than 50 similar swaps per ledger.  

We propose increasing the ledger read bytes limit to 3.5mb which will align with the other limits in allowing for 50 such swaps per ledger.

SoroSwap is one simple example, however increasing the limit will increase capacity for all Soroban protocols.
