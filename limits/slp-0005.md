## Summary

This proposal suggests increasing the per-transaction footprint limit.

## Goals Alignment

Increasing the limits will support existing protocols while allowing room for efficient and scalable everyday financial services.

## Proposed Limits

The maximum footprint size increase from 200 to 400 entries is proposed.

## Limit Change Rationale

This change is primarily driven by ecosystem maturity and developer UX. As Soroban applications have moved to more complex, stateful production workflows, legitimate transactions increasingly approach the current per-transaction footprint ceiling (200 entries). That creates avoidable friction, such as engineering workarounds, and fragmented multi-transaction flows.

Increasing the footprint limit to 400 entries (twice from the current limit) and raising corresponding in-memory read limits in tandem updates hard ceilings to better match real-world usage, improving reliability, composability, and developer productivity as the network matures.

DeFi examples where additional headroom helps:

- TWAP-aware execution on mature pools (Soroswap/Phoenix): keep richer on-chain checks together with execution.
- One-click LP maintenance (Soroswap/Phoenix): reduce multi-transaction maintenance flows (fee collection, range adjustment, re-adding liquidity).
- Routed trade reliability at scale (Soroswap/Phoenix): make heavier routes and mature pool state less brittle under current caps.
- Volatility-adjusted collateral management (Blend): allow volatility estimation and lending actions to execute atomically on-chain, reducing reliance on off-chain keepers.


## Evaluation

### Benchmarking

We're omitting benchmarking for this SLP as currently the overall footprint size per ledger is limited by the transaction sizes. With 266 KB of transactions per ledger and ~40B keys there can be at most ~6500 keys per ledger (less in practice due to transactions having other mandatory fields besides footprints). With the current limit of 200 footprint entries per transaction just 32 transactions are necessary to maximize the amount of keys per ledger, so raising the limit can't have any material impact on the amount of work done per ledger.

### Long-term protocol impact

The transaction footprint size limit has been introduced to ensure that the transaction set building and validation logic has some boundaries to work within. While this remains true, the transaction size limits provide a much stronger restriction for the amount of footprint keys per ledger and transaction and that will likely remain the case for the foreseeable future. Even with the proposed increase the footprint size per transaction stays low in the absolute sense and it's unlikely to cause the scaling issues going forward.

## Evaluation Outcome

The proposed limits increase can be considered acceptable.
