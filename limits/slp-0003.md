## Summary

This proposal suggests increasing all soroban ledger limits due to high demand and low utilization of resources. 

## Goals Alignment

Increasing the limits will support existing protocols while allowing room for efficient and scalable everyday financial services.

## Limit Change Rationale

The network is in Soroban surge pricing close to 50% of the time while validator hardware is underutilized.

This proposal is for a 2x increase across the board with some exceptions: 

- max tps: 100->1000 (10x, this is just a sanity limit and should be set high)
- entries read: 500->1000
- entries write: 250->500
- ledger read: 3500000-> 7000000
- ledger write: 143360 -> 215040 (just 1.5x, extra conservative with writes)
- instructions: 500000000 -> 1000000000

### Capacity analysis 

Current soroban traffic is heavy on Kale's `plant()` invocations submitted through Launchtube. The following table illustrates the 
impact of the proposed changes on chain capacity for these invocations: 

|                | plant()        | current-limits | current-max-invocations | proposed-limits | proposed-max-invocations |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| invocations    | 2*             | 100            | 50                      | 1000            | 500                      |
| entries-read   | 6              | 500            | 83                      | 1000            | 166                      |
| entries-write  | 4              | 250            | 62                      | 500             | 125                      |
| ledger-read    | 21,412         | 3,500,000      | 163                     | 7,000,000       | 326                      |
| ledger-write   | 1,588          | 143,360        | 90                      | 215,040         | 135                      |
| instructions   | 4,294,959      | 500,000,000    | 116                     | 1,000,000,000   | 232                      | 

*Invocations submitted via launhctube are counted as two invocations due to fee sponsorship and current counting semantics  

### Evaluation of current limits

(TBD)

### Long-term protocol impact

- Protocol 23 is expected later this year and will drastically change resource utilization. This will require rethinking these limits.
- If these ledger limits prove to be too taxing on validator hardware we can dial them back in a subsequent vote with minimal impact to app developers.
