## Summary

This proposal suggests increasing all soroban ledger limits due to high demand and low utilization of resources. 

## Goals Alignment

Increasing the limits will support existing protocols while allowing room for efficient and scalable everyday financial services.

## Limit Change Rationale

The network is in Soroban surge pricing close to 50% of the time while validator hardware is underutilized.

This proposal is for a 2x increase across the board with some exceptions: 

- max tps: 100->1000 (10x, this is just a sanity limit and should be set high)
- entries read: 500->1000
- entries write: 250->500
- ledger read: 3500000-> 7000000
- ledger write: 143360 -> 215040 (just 1.5x, extra conservative with writes)
- instructions: 500000000 -> 1000000000
