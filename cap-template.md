CAP: To Be Assigned
Title: <CAP title>
Author: <List of authors' names and optionally, email addresses, separated by commas>
Status: Draft

Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Please provide a simplified
and layman-accessible explanation of the CAP.

## Motivation
You should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the
problem that the CAP solves. In particular, CAP submissions without sufficient motivation may be
rejected outright.

### Goals Alignment
You should reference the Stellar Network goal(s) that this proposal advances, such as:
* The Stellar Network should run at scale and at low cost to all participants of the network.
* The Stellar Network should enable cross-border payments.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Design Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why
particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered
and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other protocols. The rationale may also
provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or
concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
All CAPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these
incompatibilities and their severity. The CAP must explain how the author proposes to deal with
these incompatibilities. CAP submissions with an insufficient discussion of backwards compatibility
may be rejected outright.

## Security Concerns
All CAPs should carefully consider areas where security may be a concern, and document them
accordingly. If a change does not have security implications, briefly explain why.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CAPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other
CAPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
The implementation(s) must be completed before any CAP is given "Final" status, but it need not be
completed before the CAP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on
the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running
code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
