CAP: 0024
Title:  Make PathPayment Symmetrical
Author: Jed McCaleb
Status: Draft
Created: 2019-07-08
Discussion: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/49
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary
Right now with PathPaymnet you specify how much the recipient will receive and 
how much is sent varies. There are use cases where you really want to do this 
the other way, specify how much is sent and vary how much is received.


## Abstract
We introduce a new Operation `PathPayment2` that works almost identically to 
`PathPayment` except that you set the send amount rather than the destination 
amount. 

## Specification

### XDR

```c++

enum OperationType
{
    CREATE_ACCOUNT = 0,
    PAYMENT = 1,
    PATH_PAYMENT = 2,
    MANAGE_SELL_OFFER = 3,
    CREATE_PASSIVE_SELL_OFFER = 4,
    SET_OPTIONS = 5,
    CHANGE_TRUST = 6,
    ALLOW_TRUST = 7,
    ACCOUNT_MERGE = 8,
    INFLATION = 9,
    MANAGE_DATA = 10,
    BUMP_SEQUENCE = 11,
    MANAGE_BUY_OFFER = 12,
    PATH_PAYMENT2 = 13
};


/* PathPayment2
send an amount to a destination account through a path.
(up to sendMax, sendAsset)
(X0, Path[0]) .. (Xn, Path[n])
(above destMinAmount, destAsset)
Threshold: med
Result: PathPaymentResult
*/
struct PathPayment2Op
{
    Asset sendAsset;    // asset we pay with
    int64 sendAmount;   // amount that is sent
    
    AccountID destination; // recipient of the payment
    Asset destAsset;       // what they end up with
    int64 destMinAmount;   // the minimum amount of destAsset to
                           // be received (excluding fees).
                           // The operation will fail if can't be met

    Asset path<5>; // additional hops it must go through to get there
};

```

## Backwards Incompatibilities
Should be fully backward compativle since this is just introducing a new operation.

## Security Concerns
None yet.

## Other concerns
This will require creating a new endpoint in horizon to do pathfinding in this direction.

## Test Cases
None yet.

## Implementation
None yet.
