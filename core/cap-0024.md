Title:  Make PathPayment Symmetrical

## Simple Summary
Right now `PathPaymentOp` lets you specify how much the recipient will receive
while the amount sent can vary. There are use cases where you really want to
specify the amount send while the amount received can vary.

## Motivation
The motivation to add `PathPaymentStrictSendOp` is analogous to that for adding
`ManageBuyOfferOp`: many financial institutions have an obligation to faithfully
carry out customer orders. As a concrete example, suppose that an individual
whose native currency is X is selling a house. A potential buyer whose native
currency is Y approaches the seller. They agree to a contract where the buyer
must deposit a certain amount of currency X with an escrow agent chosen by the
seller. The escrowed amount will contribute to the purchase price if the
transaction is completed, will be returned to the buyer (in currency Y) in the
event that seller defaults, and will be credited to the seller as damages in the
event that buyer defaults. The buyer can easily use `PathPaymentOp` to deposit
the agreed amount of currency X with the escrow agent. If the escrow agent needs
to transfer the escrowed funds to the seller, this can be done with `PaymentOp`.
But if the escrow agent needs to transfer the escrowed funds to the buyer (in
currency Y) then `PathPaymentOp` will not be effective because the escrow agent
would be required to guess the `destAmount` in order to send the entire escrowed
amount. In general, there is no value for the `destAmount` that guarantees that
the entire `maxSend` will be sent, so the escrow agent will not be able to meet
his obligations.

### Goals Alignment
This proposal is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goal: The Stellar
Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via exchange of
assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments between assets
in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.

## Abstract
This proposal introduces a new operation `PathPaymentStrictSendOp` that allows
a form of path payment with a strict equality constraint on the send amount
and an inequality constraint on the destination amount. The existing
`PathPayment` operation is renamed to `PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` in order to
reflect that it allows a form of path payment with a strict equality constraint
on the destination amount and an inequality constraint on the send amount.

## Specification

### XDR
We first introduce the XDR for operations `PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` and
`PathPaymentStrictSendOp`, as well as the corresponding changes to
`OperationType` and `Operation`.
```c++
enum OperationType
{
    CREATE_ACCOUNT = 0,
    PAYMENT = 1,
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE = 2,
    MANAGE_SELL_OFFER = 3,
    CREATE_PASSIVE_SELL_OFFER = 4,
    SET_OPTIONS = 5,
    CHANGE_TRUST = 6,
    ALLOW_TRUST = 7,
    ACCOUNT_MERGE = 8,
    INFLATION = 9,
    MANAGE_DATA = 10,
    BUMP_SEQUENCE = 11,
    MANAGE_BUY_OFFER = 12,
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND = 13
};

struct PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp
{
    Asset sendAsset; // asset we pay with
    int64 sendMax;   // the maximum amount of sendAsset to
                     // send (excluding fees).
                     // The operation will fail if can't be met

    AccountID destination; // recipient of the payment
    Asset destAsset;       // what they end up with
    int64 destAmount;      // amount they end up with

    Asset path<5>; // additional hops it must go through to get there
};

struct PathPaymentStrictSendOp
{
    Asset sendAsset;  // asset we pay with
    int64 sendAmount; // amount of sendAsset to send (excluding fees)

    AccountID destination; // recipient of the payment
    Asset destAsset;       // what they end up with
    int64 destMin;         // the minimum amount of dest asset to
                           // be received
                           // The operation will fail if it can't be met

    Asset path<5>; // additional hops it must go through to get there
};

struct Operation
{
    // sourceAccount is the account used to run the operation
    // if not set, the runtime defaults to "sourceAccount" specified at
    // the transaction level
    AccountID* sourceAccount;

    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACOUNT, PAYMENT unchanged ...
    case PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE:
        PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp pathPaymentStrictReceiveOp;
    // ... MANAGE_SELL_OFFER, ..., MANAGE_BUY_OFFER unchanged ...
    case PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND:
        PathPaymentStrictSendOp pathPaymentStrictSendOp;
    }
    body;
};
```

We next introduce the result types `PathPaymentStrictReceiveResult` and
`PathPaymentStrictSendResult`, as well as the corresponding changes to
`OperationResult`.
```c++
enum PathPaymentStrictReceiveResultCode
{
    // codes considered as "success" for the operation
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_SUCCESS = 0, // success

    // codes considered as "failure" for the operation
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_MALFORMED = -1,          // bad input
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_UNDERFUNDED = -2,        // not enough funds in source account
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_SRC_NO_TRUST = -3,       // no trust line on source account
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_SRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED = -4, // source not authorized to transfer
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_NO_DESTINATION = -5,     // destination account does not exist
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_NO_TRUST = -6,           // dest missing a trust line for asset
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_NOT_AUTHORIZED = -7,     // dest not authorized to hold asset
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_LINE_FULL = -8,          // dest would go above their limit
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_NO_ISSUER = -9,          // missing issuer on one asset
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_TOO_FEW_OFFERS = -10,    // not enough offers to satisfy path
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_OFFER_CROSS_SELF = -11,  // would cross one of its own offers
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_OVER_SENDMAX = -12       // could not satisfy sendmax
};

union PathPaymentStrictReceiveResult switch (PathPaymentStrictReceiveResultCode code)
{
case PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_SUCCESS:
    struct
    {
        ClaimOfferAtom offers<>;
        SimplePaymentResult last;
    } success;
case PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_NO_ISSUER:
    Asset noIssuer; // the asset that caused the error
default:
    void;
};

enum PathPaymentStrictSendResultCode
{
    // codes considered as "success" for the operation
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_SUCCESS = 0, // success

    // codes considered as "failure" for the operation
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_MALFORMED = -1,          // bad input
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_UNDERFUNDED = -2,        // not enough funds in source account
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_SRC_NO_TRUST = -3,       // no trust line on source account

    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_DESTINATION = -5,     // destination account does not exist
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_TRUST = -6,           // dest missing a trust line for asset
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NOT_AUTHORIZED = -7,     // dest not authorized to hold asset
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_LINE_FULL = -8,          // dest would go above their limit
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_ISSUER = -9,          // missing issuer on one asset
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_TOO_FEW_OFFERS = -10,    // not enough offers to satisfy path
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_OFFER_CROSS_SELF = -11,  // would cross one of its own offers
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_UNDER_DESTMIN = -12      // could not satisfy destMin
};

union PathPaymentStrictSendResult switch (PathPaymentStrictSendResultCode code)
{
case PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_SUCCESS:
    struct
    {
        ClaimOfferAtom offers<>;
        SimplePaymentResult last;
    } success;
case PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_ISSUER:
    Asset noIssuer; // the asset that caused the error
default:
    void;
};

union OperationResult switch (OperationResultCode code)
{
case opINNER:
    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACOUNT, PAYMENT unchanged ...
    case PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE:
        PathPaymentStrictReceiveResult pathPaymentStrictReceiveResult;
    // ... MANAGE_SELL_OFFER, ..., MANAGE_BUY_OFFER unchanged ...
    case PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND:
        PathPaymentStrictSendResult pathPaymentStrictSendResult;
    }
    tr;
default:
    void;
};
```

### Semantics
`PathPaymentStrictSendOp` returns

- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_DESTINATION` if issuer checks are not bypassed
and `destAccount` does not exist
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_ISSUER` if issuer checks are not bypassed and the
issuer of `sendAsset` does not exist
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_SRC_NO_TRUST` if `sendAsset` is not native and
`sourceAccount` does not own a trust line for `sendAsset`
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_SRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED` if `sendAsset` is not native and
the trust line for `sendAsset` owned by `sourceAccount` is not authorized
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_UNDERFUNDED` if `sourceAccount` does not have sufficient
available balance of `sendAsset` after accounting for selling liabilities and
base reserve (if `sendAsset` is native)
- For each `(S, R)` in `(sendAsset, path[0]), (path[0], path[1]), ...,
(path[n-1], path[n]), (path[n], destAsset)` with `S != R`
    - `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_ISSUER` if `R` is not native and the issuer
of `R` does not exist
    - `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_OFFER_CROSS_SELF` if an offer owned by
`sourceAccount` was encountered between `S` and `R` before sending the required
amount of `S`
    - `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_TOO_FEW_OFFERS` if less than the required amount
of `S` was sent before exhausting all offers between `S` and `R`
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_UNDER_DESTMIN` if the amount sent to the destination
does not exceed `destMin`
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_ISSUER` if issuer checks are not bypassed and the
issuer of `destAsset` does not exist
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_TRUST` if `destAsset` is not native and `destAccount`
does not own a trust line for `destAsset`
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NOT_AUTHORIZED` if `destAsset` is not native and the
trust line for `destAsset` owned by `destAccount` is not authorized
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_LINE_FULL` if `destAccount` does not have sufficient
available limit of `destAsset` after accounting for buying liabilities
- `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_SUCCESS` otherwise

If `PathPaymentStrictSendOp` succeeds then the source account is debited exactly
`sendAmount` of `sendAsset` and the `destAccount` is credited at least `destMin`
of `destAsset`. In order to achieve this goal, it was required to introduce a
new rounding mode (see CAP-0004 for context). We provide an informal description
of what occurs and why; for a detailed proof please refer to the implementation.
This rounding mode may only differ from the typical rounding behavior if the offer
is larger than the remnants of the conversion (this can only occur for the last
offer crossed in each step of the path). In this case, the remaining quantity of
`S` will be converted into the maximum amount of `R` that is possible (given
limits on the conversion and the offer) such that the price remains favorable to
the owner of the offer. This is the correct behavior because

- The entire amount available to be sent is in fact sent if it is possible to do
so
- The received amount is the maximum possible while continuing to meet the
requirement that it must favor the owner of the offer

## Design Rationale
Every design decision concerning `PathPaymentStrictSendOp` was decided to make the
operation "dual" to `PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` in as many ways as possible. With
that context in mind, the central design decision for `PathPaymentStrictSendOp`
was enforcing the requirement that it must send exactly the specified `sendAmount`.
This decision has the following advantages, analogous to the advantages of having
`PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` receive exactly the specified `destAmount`

- The semantics of the operation are simple to explain
- The state of the `sourceAccount` and `destAccount` is predictable after the
operation executes

## Backwards Incompatibilities
All downstream systems will need updated XDR in order to recognize the new
operation.
