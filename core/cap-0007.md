```

## Simple Summary
We introduce CreateDeterministicAccount operation which creates an account that
could only be created by the transaction creating it, allowing it to have a
known starting sequence number and initialization.

## Abstract


Deterministic accounts are a critical infrastructure piece for building reliable contracts for three key reasons:

1) Predictable sequence numbers
2) Never-fail creation
3) Known initialized state

We create deterministic accounts with a few changes to account structures to support non-key account IDs.

## Motivation

Currently, when a contract must create an account as a part of it's settlement (such as in Starlight or in an Account Transfer),
creating the account results in an unpredictable sequence number which prevents the presigning of transactions for it. Furthermore,
accounts can not be created and modified at the same time preventing initializing an account on behalf of another party.


## Specification


We extend the AccountID type:

```c++

enum AccountIDType
{
    ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_ED25519 = KEY_TYPE_ED25519,
    ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_HASH_DET_ACCOUNT = 3,
    ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT = 4,
    ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_REF_NEW_DET_ACCOUNT = 5,
};


union AccountID switch (AccountIDType type)
{
case ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_ED25519:
    uint256 ed25519;
case ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_HASH_DET_ACCOUNT:
    uint256 ed25519;
case ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT:
    void;
case ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_REF_NEW_DET_ACCOUNT:
    int64 which;
};


```



We add the following operation:
```c++
struct CreateDeterministicAccountOp
{
    int64 startingBalance;
};
```

The result of this operation is an account created with the following state:
```c++
AccountEntry
{
    accountID = SHA512().hash(tx.hash)
                        .hash(op.index)
                        .digest(),
    balance = op.startingBalance,
    seqNum = 0,
    masterWeight = 0,
}
```

Following this operation, inside the scope of the transaction executing, the
transactions implicit account ID is `ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT`. This
allows a transaction to refer to the deterministic account before hashing.

Inside the scope of the transaction creating it, the deterministic account is
also implicitly unlocked with the highest threshold.

Therefore subsequent operations with source account set to
`ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT` such as `SetOptions` modify this account.
This operation works with Account Merge, but subsequently
`ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT` refers to no account.


Alternatively, we may store a vector of pointers to the accounts being created
(in the implementation) and refer to them by creation order. In this case, we
use `ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_REF_NEW_DET_ACCOUNT`.  `which=0` points to the first
account created, `1` the second, etc. `which= = -1` refers to the most recently
created account, `-2` the next most recently created, etc. Only one of
`ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_REF_NEW_DET_ACCOUNT` or `ACCOUNT_ID_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT`
should make it into the final draft of the spec.

The account has no master signer, therefore setting masterWeight has no effect
(but can be used as an extra data field if desired).

Deterministic accounts may always be merged even if the sequence number is above the
current ledger, as there is no way to recreate them after merge.



## Rationale

CreateDeterministicAccount is a minimal deterministic account derivation scheme.

The newly created account is deterministically derived from

- The transaction creating it, which transitively commits to:
    - The Source Account
    - The Source Account Sequence
- The index of the operation in the transaction (making a unique key if repeated CreateDeterministicAccount operations)


Alternative schemes to this deterministic account proposal derive only on the
source account, sequence number, and operation index rather than the complete
transaction hash. While strictly speaking, this should work for many of the use
cases where deterministic accounts are desired, and does not encumber the
complexity of not knowing the account ID inside the transaction, there are two
main drawbacks that leade to this approach being superior. The first drawback is
that there are multiple possible transactions that *could* create the account,
which makes it possible for a malicious actor to trick another agent in certain
cases. For example, if a 2 party protocol is proposed by the malicious actor,
signatures are acquired, but then the malicious actor aborts, and then the
protocol is restarted with different values, the other party may not recall that
they have already approved a transaction in the first protocol. The second
drawback is that because of the multiplicity of generation of this variant of
deterministic account, the existence of the account does not serve as a
testament to the success of the operations in the transaction which created the
account. Such testaments are useful for complex contracts as they can rely on
state implied by the existence of an account (such as the current signer of
another account modified in the generating transaction being the same signer as
a third account). The abscence of these two drawbacks simultaneously makes this
version of deterministic accounts less useful for attackers and more useful for
contracting.

An example of using CreateDeterministicAccount is as follows:

```c++
Tx0:
    Operations:
        CreateDeterministicAccount 10 XLM
        SetOptions  PUBLIC_KEY_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT
            - low threshold: 1
            - med threshold: 1
            - hi threshold: 1
            - signer: {ALICE'S KEY, 1}
        ChangeTrust PUBLIC_KEY_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT
            - Line: Some Line
            - Limit: None
        CreateDeterministicAccount 10 XLM
        SetOptions  PUBLIC_KEY_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT
            - low threshold: 1
            - med threshold: 1
            - hi threshold: 1
            - signer: {BOB'S KEY, 1}
        ChangeTrust PUBLIC_KEY_TYPE_NEWEST_DET_ACCOUNT
            - Line: Some Line
            - Limit: None
```

The in-transaction setup guarantees that if the account is created it is in the
desired state.


Protocols around using CreateDeterministicAccount will be the subject of a
subsequent SEP.


Because of the hash cycle (account ID is transaction hash, transaction therefore
can't include it), pre-auth transactions will not work immediately for
Deterministic Accounts as described. A subsequent CAP will propose allowing a
preauth transaction to specify _self_ as the source account for a pre-auth, which
relaxes this constraint.

The newest account account ID type is of limited use. There are certain cases
that it does not work for (such as making two deterministic accounts which
approve trust lines for each other). The alternative form adds more complexity
and bookkeeping cost, but provides a simpler API for implementers and supports
all possible initializations. If the added complexity is not too much, it should
be preferred. The ability to refer by negative indexes is useful for defining
templates which should nest inside of other transactions without need to
recompute indexes.

The decision to not include the master signer is a trade off. On the one hand,
it means deterministic accounts cannot include as many public key signers as
non-deterministic accounts. On the other hand 20 signers is likely enough for
most use cases, and the lack of the master key makes account handling code
simpler. MuSig based signature constructions also support constructing larger
multisig circuits as well, so it is unclear how much utility is gained by having
one more signer. Another field for a signer could be added to deterministic
accounts, but this would bloat the account struct further and would break
compatibility with older software. Potentially, the 20 signer limit could be
changed to 21 and run time checked (somehow) to only be allowed for
deterministic accounts. This would allow SDK authors to provide identical
interfaces. If this is needed, it should be the subject of a separate CAP
finalized in conjunction with this CAP. The other ergonomics issue is that it
might be surprising to a implementer that there is no default signer and might
result in them creating accounts in a frozen state. This is desirable however --
for many types of smart contract, there is no such concept as a master signer
    (just a few determinisitc steps) and for issuing fixed supply or fixed
    schedule tokens you would only want to use pre signed transactions and a
    master signer would be superflous.



## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal requires updating existing APIs to accept the new key types.


Future work should clean up the XDR AccountID typedef to be an enum.


## Implementation
No implementation yet.
