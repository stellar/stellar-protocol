## Simple Summary
This proposal makes it possible to pay reserves for another account.

## Motivation
This proposal seeks to solve the following problem: an entity should be able to
provide the reserve for accounts controlled by other parties without giving
those parties control of the reserve.

Consider, for example, an issuer that is willing to pay the reserve for trust
lines to the asset it issues. With the current version of the protocol, the
reserve must be part of the balance of an account. This means the issuer can
only pay the reserve by sending native asset to accounts that create a trust
line to the asset it issues. But this leaves the issuer vulnerable to attack
because an attacker can extract funds from the issuer by creating new accounts,
creating the trust line, waiting for the native asset to arrive, then removing
the trust line and merging the account.

This proposal is in many ways analogous to CAP-0015:

- CAP-0015 makes it possible to pay transaction fees for other accounts without
giving control of the underlying funds
- CAP-0033 makes it possible to pay reserves for other accounts without giving
control of the underlying funds

The combination of these two proposals should greatly facilitate the development
of non-custodial uses of the Stellar Network.

### Goals Alignment
This proposal is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goal:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products.

## Abstract
We introduce the relation is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for, in which an account
(the sponsoring account) pays any reserve that another account (the sponsored
account) would have to pay. This relation is initiated by
`SponsorFutureReservesOp`, where the sponsoring account is the source account,
and is terminated by `ConfirmAndClearSponsorOp`, where the sponsored account is
the source account. Both operations must appear in a single transaction, which
guarantees that both the sponsoring and sponsored accounts agree to every
sponsorship. We also introduce `UpdateSponsorshipOp`, which can be used to
modify the sponsorship of existing ledger entries. To support this, we add new
extensions to `AccountEntry` and `LedgerEntry` which record pertinent
information about sponsorships.

## Specification
This specification assumes CAP-0023, in order to show how sponsorships would
work for claimable balance entries.

### XDR

#### AccountEntry
```c++
typedef AccountID* SponsorshipDescriptor;

struct AccountEntryExtensionV2
{
    uint32 numSponsored;  // Number of reserves sponsored for this account
                          // Reduces the reserve requirement for this account
    uint32 numSponsoring; // Number of reserves sponsored by this account
                          // Increases the reserve requirement for this account

    // signerSponsoringIDs are in 1-to-1 correspondence with signers, so
    // the account sponsoring signer[i] is signerSponsoringIDs[i]. If
    // signerSponsoringIDs[i] is empty, then there is no sponsor
    SponsorshipDescriptor signerSponsoringIDs<20>;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};

struct AccountEntryExtensionV1
{
    Liabilities liabilities;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 2:
        AccountEntryExtensionV2 v2;
    }
    ext;
};

struct AccountEntry
{
    // ... unchanged ...

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 1:
        AccountEntryExtensionV1 v1;
    }
    ext;
};
```

#### ClaimableBalanceEntry
Note that `ClaimableBalanceEntry` is not in the current protocol, so the XDR can
still be modified. `reserve` has been removed, and `sponsoringID` has been
replaced by `sponsoringID` in `LedgerEntryExtensionV1`.

```c++
struct ClaimableBalanceEntry
{
    // Unique identifier for this ClaimableBalanceEntry
    ClaimableBalanceID balanceID;

    // List of claimants with associated predicate
    Claimant claimants<10>;

    // Any asset including native
    Asset asset;

    // Amount of asset
    int64 amount;

    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};
```

#### LedgerEntry
```c++
struct LedgerEntryExtensionV1
{
    // The account sponsoring this ledger entry. If sponsoringID is empty then
    // there is no sponsor
    SponsorshipDescriptor sponsoringID;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};

struct LedgerEntry
{
    // ... unchanged ...

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 1:
        LedgerEntryExtensionV1 v1;
    }
    ext;
};
```

#### Operations

};

struct SponsorFutureReservesOp
{
    // sponsoredID identifies the account for which future reserves will be
    // sponsored by the source account of this operation
    AccountID sponsoredID;
};

    UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_LEDGER_ENTRY = 0,
    UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_SIGNER = 1
};

case UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_LEDGER_ENTRY:
    // Uniquely identifies a non-signer ledger entry
    LedgerKey ledgerKey;
case UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_SIGNER:
    // Uniquely identifies a signer on a specific account
    struct
    {
        AccountID accountID;
        SignerKey signerKey;
    }
    signer;
};

struct Operation
{
    // sourceAccount is the account used to run the operation
    // if not set, the runtime defaults to "sourceAccount" specified at
    // the transaction level
    MuxedAccount* sourceAccount;

    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACCOUNT, ..., PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND unchanged ...
    case SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES:
        SponsorFutureReservesOp sponsorFutureReservesOp;
    case CONFIRM_AND_CLEAR_SPONSOR:
        void;
    case UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP:

    case txBAD_SPONSORSHIP:
        void;
    }
    result;

    // ext unchanged
};
```

### Semantics

#### Reserve Requirement
No operation can take the native balance of an account below
`(2 + numSubEntries + numSponsoring - numSponsored) * baseReserve + liabilities.selling`.

#### Sponsorship Bookkeeping
When account `A` is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for account `B`, any reserve
requirements that would normally accumulate on `B` will instead accumulate on
`A` as reflected in `numSponsoring`. Both accounts are guaranteed to exist, but
this can fail. If such a change would cause `A` to pass below the reserve
requirement, then the operation fails. The fact that these reserves are being
provided by another account will be reflected on `B` in `numSponsored`.

When a sponsored ledger entry or sub-entry is removed, `numSponsoring` is
decreased on the sponsoring account and `numSponsored` is decreased on the
sponsored account. Both accounts are guaranteed to exist, so this cannot fail.

It is an invariant that, after every operation, the sum of all changes in
`numSponsoring` exactly equals the sum of all changes in `numSponsored`.

#### Confirming Sponsorship
Within any transaction, every `SponsorFutureReservesOp s` must be paired with a
subsequent `ConfirmAndClearSponsorOp c` with `c.sourceAccount` equal to
`s.sponsoredID`. If this constraint is not met, a transaction that would
otherwise have succeeded will fail with `txBAD_SPONSORSHIP`.

#### SponsorFutureReservesOp
`SponsorFutureReservesOp` is the only operation that can initiate the
is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relation. To check validity of
`SponsorFutureReservesOp op`:

```
If op.sponsoredID = op.sourceAccount
    Invalid with SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES_MALFORMED
```

The behavior of `SponsorFutureReservesOp op` is:
```
If an account is sponsoring future reserves for op.sponsoredID
    Fail with SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES_ALREADY_SPONSORED

If an account is sponsoring future reserves for op.sourceAccount
    Fail with SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES_RECURSIVE
If op.sponsoredID is sponsoring future reserves for any account
    Fail with SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES_RECURSIVE

Record that op.sourceAccount is sponsoring future reserves for op.sponsoredID
Succeed with SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES_SUCCESS
```

`SponsorFutureReservesOp` requires medium threshold.

#### ConfirmAndClearSponsorOp
`ConfirmAndClearSponsorOp` is the only operation that can terminate the
is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for relation. `ConfirmAndClearSponsorOp` is always
valid.

The behavior of `ConfirmAndClearSponsorOp op` is:
```
If an account is not sponsoring future reserves for op.sourceAccount
    Fail with CONFIRM_AND_CLEAR_SPONSOR_NOT_SPONSORED

Record that no account is sponsoring future reserves for op.sourceAccount
Succeed with CONFIRM_AND_CLEAR_SPONSOR_SUCCESS
```

`ConfirmAndClearSponsorOp` requires medium threshold.

#### UpdateSponsorshipOp
`UpdateSponsorshipOp` allows the sponsor of existing reserves to transfer
sponsorship to another account. If an account is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for
the source account, then the new sponsor will be that account. If no account
is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for the source account, then there will be no
sponsor. Note that `UpdateSponsorshipOp` does not obey the typical rules of
sponsorship. `UpdateSponsorshipOp` is always valid.

The behavior of `UpdateSponsorshipOp op` is as follows:
```
If op.type() == UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_LEDGER_ENTRY
    mult = op.ledgerKey().type() != ACCOUNT ? 1 : 2
    requiredReserve = mult * baseReserve

    If no LedgerEntry le with LedgerKey(le) == op.ledgerKey() exists
        Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST

    wasSponsored = false
    Load LedgerEntry le with LedgerKey(le) == op.ledgerKey()
    If le.ext.v() == 0 || !le.ext.v1().sponsoringID
        If Account(le) != op.sourceAccount
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_NOT_SPONSOR
    Else
        If le.ext.v1().sponsoringID != op.sourceAccount
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_NOT_SPONSOR
        wasSponsored = true

        Load AccountEntry source with source.accountID == op.sourceAccount
        source.ext.v1().ext.v2().numSponsoring -= mult

    If an account sID is sponsoring future reserves for op.sourceAccount
        Load AccountEntry acc with acc.accountID == sID
        If AvailableBalance(acc, NATIVE) < requiredReserve
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_LOW_RESERVE
        acc.ext.v1().ext.v2().numSponsoring += mult

        le.ext.v(1)
        le.ext.v1().sponsoringID = sID
    Else
        If op.ledgerKey().type() == CLAIMABLE_BALANCE
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSOR_ONLY_TRANSFERABLE

        Load AccountEntry acc with acc.accountID == Account(le)
        If AvailableBalance(acc, NATIVE) < requiredReserve
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_LOW_RESERVE

        If wasSponsored
            acc.ext.v1().ext.v2().numSponsored -= mult
        Clear le.ext.v1().sponsoringID

Else if op.type() == UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_SIGNER
    If no AccountEntry acc with acc.accountID == op.signer().accountID exists
        Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST

    Load AccountEntry a with acc.accountID == op.signer().accountID
    If op.signer().signerKey not in acc.signers
        Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST
    Let i be such that a.signers[i].signerKey == op.signer().signerKey

    wasSponsored = false
    If a.ext.v() == 0 || a.ext.v1().ext.v() == 0
        If op.signer().accountID != op.sourceAccount
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_NOT_SPONSOR
    Else if a.ext.v1().ext.v() == 2
        If a.ext.v1().ext.v2().signerSponsoringIDs[i] != op.sourceAccount
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_NOT_SPONSOR
        wasSponsored = true

        Load AccountEntry source with source.accountID == op.sourceAccount
        source.ext.v1().ext.v2().numSponsoring--

    If an account sID is sponsoring future reserves for op.sourceAccount
        Load AccountEntry acc with acc.accountID == sID
        If AvailableBalance(acc, NATIVE) < baseReserve
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_LOW_RESERVE
        acc.ext.v1().ext.v2().numSponsoring++

        Set a.ext.v(1)
        Set a.ext.v1().ext.v(2)
        a.ext.v1().ext.v2().signerSponsoringIDs[i].sponsoringID = sID
    Else
        If AvailableBalance(a, NATIVE) < requiredReserve
            Fail with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_LOW_RESERVE

        If wasSponsored
            a.ext.v1().ext.v2().numSponsoring--
        Clear a.ext.v1().ext.v2().signerSponsoringIDs[i].sponsoringID

Succeed with UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS
```

`UpdateSponsorshipOp` requires medium threshold.

#### AccountMergeOp
`AccountMergeOp` will fail with `ACCOUNT_MERGE_IS_SPONSOR` if attempting to
merge an account that is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for another account. This
guarantees that the sponsoring account always exists.

Similarly, `AccountMergeOp` will fail with `ACCOUNT_MERGE_IS_SPONSOR` if
attempting to merge an account that has non-zero `numSponsoring`. This is
required for sponsorship bookkeeping.

#### CreateAccountOp
`CreateAccountOp` will now be valid if `startingBalance >= 0`, whereas prior to
this proposal it was valid if `startingBalance > 0`.

#### Other Operations
Other operations will need updated semantics in order to behave correctly with
this proposal. Specifically, changes will be required to handle sponsorship
wherever ledger entries are created or removed.

## Design Rationale

### Sponsorship Logic is Off-Chain
In CAP-0031, an alternative approach to sponsorship, the logic for determining
what can be sponsored is stored on the ledger. Not only is this complicated to
implement and reason about, but it also introduces a variety of limitations in
terms of what logic is supported. Moving sponsorship logic off-chain through
the "sandwich approach", analogous to what is done in CAP-0018, eliminates all
of these disadvantages.

### Why Should Sponsorship be Ephemeral?
There are a variety of reasons that the is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for
relation is ephemeral (by which I mean contained within a single transaction).
From a practical perspective, it would be deeply unwise to delegate to another
party the right to make decisions about how your funds can be used to pay
reserves. If you were to do this, then the other party could drain your entire
balance.

But the technical reasons are far more compelling. Ephemeral sponsorship
guarantees that both the sponsoring and sponsored accounts must sign any
transaction that establishes a sponsorship relation. This applies even in the
case of sponsorship for `CreateAccountOp`, whereas `CreateAccountOp` can
usually be used without a signature from the created account. As a consequence,
sponsorship introduces absolutely no backwards compatibility issues with regard
to pre-signed transactions or pre-authorized transactions.

Because every sponsorship requires agreement from the sponsoring and sponsored
accounts, it is safe to allow sponsorship revocation when the sponsored account
can afford the reserve itself. That is part of the contract of the sponsorship
relation, and if you didn't want revocation to occur then you shouldn't have
accepted the sponsorship in the first place.

### Sponsoring Accounts Cannot be Merged
An account that is-sponsoring-future-reserves-for another account cannot be
merged. This does not constrain functionality at all, but simplifies the
implementation and reduces the number of possible errors that can be encountered
by downstream systems. Any transaction where this requirement would have been
the difference between success and failure necessarily contains both a
`SponsorFutureReservesOp` and a `ConfirmAndClearSponsorOp`. These operations
could simply be rearranged to permit the merge.

An account that is the current sponsor for any ledger entry or sub-entry cannot
be merged. If you want to merge such an account, then you can use
`UpdateSponsorshipOp` to transfer the sponsorships to another account. Again,
this restriction greatly simplifies the implementation and semantics.

### Sequence Number Utilization and Sponsoring Account Creation
A typical use case for sponsorship is an enterprise sponsoring the reserves for
customers. Because sponsorship requires signatures from both the sponsoring
account and the sponsored account, this requires multi-signature coordination.
But an enterprise may be coordinating many such signatures at once. Each
coordination requires a sequence number. When sponsoring sub-entries such as
signers and trust lines, it is possible to use the customer's sequence number.
But sponsoring account creation requires the enterprise to provide the sequence
number. This will likely require a pool of channel accounts, which is a source
of complexity.

Despite the complexity that will be required for large-scale creation of
sponsored accounts, we still believe that this approach is justified by its many
benefits. Furthermore, the need for channel accounts during multi-signature
coordination is an area in which the Stellar protocol can be generally improved.
Already there are discussions of ideas which may mitigate some of these issues
such as David Mazieres' proposal for Authenticated Operations, which can be found
at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/stellar-dev/zpO0Eppn8ks/e1ULbV_lAgAJ.

### Why are Signer Sponsoring IDs Stored Separately from Signers?
For ledger entries, the sponsoring ID is stored within the ledger entry. But for
signers, the sponsoring ID is stored separately. Why take different approaches?
The reason is that `LedgerEntry` has an extension point but `Signer` does not.
So if we wanted to store the sponsoring ID in the signer, then we would need to
extend the `SignerKey` union. But this would force any downstream system that
interacts with signers to update as well, introducing complexity throughout the
ecosystem. Storing the sponsoring IDs for signers separately avoids this problem
entirely, but it is perhaps slightly less elegant. Still, the trade-off is more
than justified.

### Why Doesn't UpdateSponsorshipOp Obey Typical Rules of Sponsorship?
The relationship between sponsoring account and sponsored account can only be
created by mutual agreement. When this relationship is established, the
sponsoring account is endowed with the right to unilaterally end the
relationship (ie. revoke the sponsorship) as long as doing so will not leave the
sponsored account below the reserve requirement. But revoking the sponsorship
is strictly worse for the sponsored account than transferring the sponsorship,
because the worst thing that the new sponsoring account can do is revoke the
sponsorship. Therefore, the sponsoring account should be able to transfer the
sponsorship with the consent of the new sponsoring account but unilaterally with
respect to the sponsored account.

So how would a transfer work if `UpdateSponsorshipOp` were to obey the typical
rules of sponsorship? Let `S1` be the current sponsor, `S2` be the new sponsor,
`K` be the `LedgerKey` for an entry sponsored by `S1`, and `A` be the account
which controls the entry identified by `K`. We would need a transaction with

1. `S2` is source for `SponsorFutureReservesOp` with `sponsoredID = A`
2. `S1` is source for `UpdateSponsorshipOp` with `ledgerKey = K`
3. `A` is source for `ConfirmAndClearSponsorshipOp`

But this clearly requires a signature from the sponsored account, so if we are
to satisfy the "unilateral" semantics described above then this approach cannot
work.

This also resolves an issue for `ClaimableBalanceEntry`, because there is no
notion of an account that controls a `ClaimableBalanceEntry`.

### Example: Sponsoring Account Creation
In this example, we demonstrate how an account can be sponsored upon creation.
Let `S` be the sponsoring account, `C` be the creating account, and `A` the
newly created account (`S` and `C` may be the same account). Then the following
transaction achieves the desired goal:

```
sourceAccount: C
fee: <FEE>
seqNum: <SEQ_NUM>
timeBounds: <TIME_BOUNDS>
memo:
    type: MEMO_NONE
operations[0]:
    sourceAccount: S
    body:
        type: SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES
        sponsoredID: A
operations[1]:
    sourceAccount: C
    body:
        type: CREATE_ACCOUNT
        destination: A
        startingBalance: <STARTING_BALANCE>
operations[2]:
    sourceAccount: A
    body:
        type: CONFIRM_AND_CLEAR_SPONSOR
```

where `<FEE>`, `<SEQ_NUM>`, `<TIME_BOUNDS>`, and `<STARTING_BALANCE>` should all
be substituted appropriately. Note that this requires a signature from `A` even
though that account is being created.

### Example: Two Trust Lines with Different Sponsors
In this example, we demonstrate how a single account can create two trust lines
which are sponsored by different accounts in a single transaction. Let `S1` and
`S2` be the sponsoring accounts. Let `A` be the sponsored account. Then the
following transaction achieves the desired goal:

```
sourceAccount: A
fee: <FEE>
seqNum: <SEQ_NUM>
timeBounds: <TIME_BOUNDS>
memo:
    type: MEMO_NONE
operations[0]:
    sourceAccount: S1
    body:
        type: SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES
        sponsoredID: A
operations[1]:
    sourceAccount: A
    body:
        type: CHANGE_TRUST
        line: X
        limit: INT64_MAX
operations[2]:
    sourceAccount: A
    body:
        type: CONFIRM_AND_CLEAR_SPONSOR
operations[3]:
    sourceAccount: S2
    body:
        type: SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES
        sponsoredID: A
operations[4]:
    sourceAccount: A
    body:
        type: CHANGE_TRUST
        line: Y
        limit: INT64_MAX

where `<FEE>`, `<SEQ_NUM>`, and `<TIME_BOUNDS>` should all be substituted
appropriately.

### Example: Revoke Sponsorship
In this example, we demonstrate how a sponsorship can be revoked. Let `S`
be the sponsoring account. Let `K` be the `LedgerKey` for an entry which
is currently sponsored by `S`. Then the following transaction achieves the
desired goal:

```
sourceAccount: S
fee: <FEE>
seqNum: <SEQ_NUM>
timeBounds: <TIME_BOUNDS>
memo:
    type: MEMO_NONE
operations[0]:
    sourceAccount: S
    body:
        type: UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP
        ledgerKey: K
```

where `<FEE>`, `<SEQ_NUM>`, and `<TIME_BOUNDS>` should all be substituted
appropriately.

### Example: Transfer Sponsorship
In this example, we demonstrate how a sponsorship can be transferred. Let `S1`
and `S2` be the sponsoring accounts. Let `K` be the `LedgerKey` for an entry
which is currently sponsored by `S1`. Then the following transaction achieves
the desired goal:

```
sourceAccount: S1
fee: <FEE>
seqNum: <SEQ_NUM>
timeBounds: <TIME_BOUNDS>
memo:
    type: MEMO_NONE
operations[0]:
    sourceAccount: S2
    body:
        type: SPONSOR_FUTURE_RESERVES
        sponsoredID: S1
operations[1]:
    sourceAccount: S1
    body:
        type: UPDATE_SPONSORSHIP
        ledgerKey: K
operations[2]:
    sourceAccount: S1
    body:
        type: CONFIRM_AND_CLEAR_SPONSOR
```

where `<FEE>`, `<SEQ_NUM>`, and `<TIME_BOUNDS>` should all be substituted
appropriately.

## Backwards Incompatibilities

### New XDR
All downstream systems will need updated XDR in order to recognize the new
operations and the modified ledger entries.

### Operation Validity Changes
Any downstream system relying on the fact that `CreateAccountOp` is invalid if
`startingBalance = 0` will be affected.

## Security Concerns
This proposal will slightly reduce the efficacy of base reserve changes, because
sponsored ledger entries cannot cause an account to pass below the reserve
requirement.

## Test Cases
None yet.

## Implementation
None yet.
