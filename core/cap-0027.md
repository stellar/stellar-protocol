## Simple Summary

A new type of Account IDs includes a 64-bit memo ID.  This memo ID has
no effect on the semantics of operations or their authorization, but
it facilitates multiplexing a single account across multiple users.

## Motivation

A common pattern in the Stellar ecosystem is for services to share a
single Stellar account ID across many users, relying on the memo ID to
disambiguate incoming payments.

Experience shows that people frequently forget to include the memo ID,
resulting in either lost funds or onerous support calls.  Moreover,
memo IDs are per transaction, not per occurrence of an account ID,
which imposes restrictions on the use of multiplexed accounts.  For
example, it is not possible to include multiple payments to different
multiplexed accounts in the same transaction.  Similarly, it is not
possible to refund payments from a multiplexed account ID, as the
transaction's memo ID by convention describes only the destination,
not the source of funds.

By adding an optional memo ID to the account ID type, we make
multiplexed accounts a first-class abstraction that can be used
anywhere a normal account ID can be used.

### Goals Alignment

First-class multiplexed accounts help scalability by eliminating an
incentive for users to create many accounts when virtual accounts
would suffice.  They also significantly improve usability by
addressing the pain point of support costs for users who forget memo
IDs.

## Abstract

A new type, `MuxedAccount`, replaces `AccountID` in many places.  A
`MuxedAccount` can contain either a plain Ed25519 public key, or a
public key and a 64-bit subaccount ID.  The subaccount ID has no
effect on the semantics of transactions, but can be used by
higher-layer software to multiplex a single stellar account among
multiple users.

## Specification

The multiplexed account type is represented by a new XDR union:

~~~ {.c}
// Source or destination of a payment operation
union MuxedAccount switch (CryptoKeyType type) {
 case KEY_TYPE_ED25519:
     uint256 ed25519;
 case KEY_TYPE_MUXED_ED25519:
     struct {
         uint256 ed25519;
         uint64 id;
     } med25519;
};
~~~

The following fields, which were previously an `AccountID` or
`AccountID*`, are now a `MuxedAccount` or `MuxedAccount*`
(repectively):

* `PaymentOp::destination`
* `PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp::destination`
* `PathPaymentStrictSendOp::destination`
* `Operation::sourceAccount`
* `Operation::destination` (for `ACCOUNT_MERGE`)
* `Transaction::sourceAccount`
* `SimplePaymentResult::destination`

Note, however, that this must not be implemented before CAP-0015 or
CAP-0019 (which updates the transaction format), as these other CAPs
depend on all existing transactions starting with 4 zero bytes (which
will no longer be the case when the transaction's `sourceAccount` is a
`MuxedAccount`).

### Strkey update

Multiplexed accounts need a new ASCII format representation, so we
must extend strkey, the existing encoding we have for ED25519 public
keys, ED25519 private keys (also known as seeds), pre-authorized
transaction hashes, and hash-x signers (which provide signing
authority upon revelation of a SHA-256 preimage). We do this by adding
a fifth type representing multiplexed account IDs named by ED25519
keys.  Each of these types has a corresponding version byte, which
determines the first character of the strkey encoding:

| Key type                | Version byte | First char | Muxed |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| STRKEY\_PUBKEY\_ED25519 | 6 << 3       | G          | no    |
| STRKEY\_PUBKEY\_ED25519 | 12 << 3      | M          | yes   |
| STRKEY\_SEED\_ED25519   | 18 << 3      | S          | no    |
| STRKEY\_PRE\_AUTH\_TX   | 19 << 3      | T          | no    |
| STRKEY\_HASH\_X         | 23 << 3      | X          | no    |


The following steps transform a binary key into a strkey:

1.  Start with the appropriate version byte from the above table.

2.  If it is a multiplexed address, append an 8-byte memo ID in
    network byte order (most significant byte first).

3.  Append the binary bytes of the key (e.g., 32-bytes for ED25519).

4.  Compute a 16-bit CRC16 checksum of the combined version byte,
    optional memo ID, and binary key (using polynomial
    x<sup>16</sup> + x<sup>12</sup> + x<sup>5</sup> + 1). Append the
    two-byte checksum to the result of the previous step (e.g.,
    producing a 35-byte quantity for a non-multiplexed ED25519 public
    key, or 43 byte quantity for a multiplexed one).

3.  Encode the result of the previous step using [RFC4648 base-32
    encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-6).

Note that the version bytes all consist of values shifted left by
three because the first character of base-32-encoded output is
determined by the most significant 5 bits of the first byte.

## Design Rationale

An ecosystem-only proposal (SEP-0023) was proposed, but had too many
limitations, including the inability to send payments to several
virtual accounts, the inability to specify virtual accounts as a
source, and increased cognitive load for developers.  The CAP approach
seems much cleaner, with very little added complexity in the server.

The particular set of fields promoted to `MuxedAccount` were chosen to
avoid any changes to the database.  Hence, assets and offers are still
associated with an `AccountID` rather than a `MuxedAccount`.

As for the strkey update, there are 3 bits at the bottom of each
version byte that do not affect the first character.  Hence, when new
types of public keys are added, we anticipate using these bits to
distinguish between up to 8 types of key.  This means 8 public key
types can have a simple version starting with `G` and a multiplexed
version starting with `M`.

## Backwards Incompatibilities

All existing transactions will continue to be valid, but transactions
with a `MuxedAccount` will not be parsable by old software.  Hence,
the best time to roll out this change will be at the same time as
CAP-0015.  Software that converts new-style transactions to old can
also strip out the identifiers from `MuxedAccount` structures.

## Security Concerns

Certain addresses that are identical may not look identical.  This
could confuse client software.  For instance, sending an asset to a
multiplexed account tied to the issuer will destroy the asset.

## Test Cases

None yet.

## Implementation

An implementation can be fetched to `FETCH_HEAD` with the following
command:

```
git fetch git@github.com:xdrpp/stellar-core dm/muxacct
```
