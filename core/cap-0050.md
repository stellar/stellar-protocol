## Simple Summary

Implement a simple way to interact with smart contracts.

## Motivation

In Ethereum, contracts typically assume that they have the authority to take
actions in the name of `msg.sender`. `msg.sender` is an address, meaning it can
correspond to either an externally owned account or a contract. For example,

- the ERC-20 `transfer` function sends funds from `msg.sender` to some other
  address
- the ERC-20 `approve` function sets the allowance for `spender` to transfer
funds from `msg.sender`
- the ERC-20 `transferFrom` function sends funds from some address `A` to
  address `B` if `msg.sender` has sufficient allowance

In this model, an address "owns" something when it can become `msg.sender`. An
externally owned account becomes `msg.sender` by submitting a transaction with
a single signature from the appropriate public key. A contract becomes
`msg.sender` by making a cross-contract call.

This approach has proven to be both simple and powerful. Ownership by an
externally owned account is simply secured by a single secret key. But a smart
wallet can be employed for more powerful ownership controls. For example, if a
user wants to establish 2/3 multisignature control over assets then they can
deploy a smart contract which receives an action and a set of signatures,
verifies the signatures, checks that they satisfy the access control policy,
then takes the specified action. This smart wallet becomes the literal owner of
the assets, but control of the smart wallet is delegated to those with signing
authority. As another example, if a user wants to enable key rotation then they
can deploy a smart contract which receives an action and a signature, verifies
the signature using the currently set signing key, then takes the specified
action (the specified action includes the possibility of setting a new key).

This attitude of simplicity-by-default but flexibility-when-needed has been a
foundational element of usability on Ethereum. Rather than reinvent the wheel,
Stellar should adopt this paradigm to immediately maximize the usability of
smart contracts.

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products

## Abstract

This proposal introduces `InvokeContractTransaction` and
`InvokeContractTransactionEnvelope` which permit interacting with contracts.
To maximize usability, a `InvokeContractTransactionEnvelope` takes an
additional `KeyedSignature` which identifies who has invoked the contract
(analogous to `msg.sender` in Ethereum). The proposal also introduces a new
host function, `get_invoker`, so a contract can identify who has invoked the
contract. The proposal also contains a number of extensions to support
presigned messages, which would be relevant for an EIP-2612 style `permit`
function, and the ability to run WASM directly in a transaction.

### Semantics

#### No Changes to Overlay or Transaction Queue

`InvokeContractTransactionEnvelope` is a new type of `TransactionEnvelope` and
utilizes the same replay protection rules, so all downstream concepts such as
overlay messages and transaction queue work without modification.

#### Message Sender

Whenever a contract is executing, the contract can determine the identity of the
caller by invoking the host function

```rust
fn get_invoker() -> Address;
```

#### External Interaction with a Smart Contract

To interact with a contract, a user will submit an
`InvokeContractTransactionEnvelope env` with the following properties:

- `env.tx.seqNum = seqNum(env.tx.sourceAccount) + 1`
- `availableBalance(env.tx.sourceAccount) >= env.tx.fee`
- `env.tx.contractID` is the contract you want to interact with
- `env.tx.symbol` is the function you want to call on the contract
- `env.tx.parameters` are the parameters you want to pass to the function
- `env.signatures` are valid signatures for signers of `env.tx.sourceAccount`
with total weight exceeding `lowThreshold(env.tx.sourceAccount)`
- `env.invokerSignature.signature` is a valid signature for
`env.invokerSignature.key`

Immediately after the contract begins execution, a call to `get_invoker()` will
return `env.invokerSignature.key`.

#### Cross-Contract Calls

To make a cross-contract call, a contract can invoke the host function

```rust
// parameters must be a vector
fn call(contractID: ContractID, symbol: SCSymbol, parameters: SCVal) -> SCVal;
```

which loads `f = loadSymbol(contractID, symbol)` then invokes
`f(parameters[0], ..., parameters[n])` where `n` is the length of `parameters`.
Immediately after the contract begins execution, a call to `get_invoker()` will
return the `ContractID` for the calling contract.

## Design Rationale

### The Necessity of KeyedSignature

Ethereum uses ECDSA, which makes it possible to recover the public key from a
signature. This is not possible with EdDSA, so the public key must be provided.
Unlike with `DecoratedSignature`, a hint is not sufficient as there is no fixed
list to compare against.

### Message Sender Does Not Acquire Signing Authority Over a Stellar Account

This proposal logically separates the notion of a Stellar account and an address
which controls assets in a smart contract. Specifically, control over a Stellar
account with a given public key is _not_ conferred by control over assets in a
smart contract with the same public key. For example, a Stellar account might
have its master weight set to 0 while its public key grants control over assets
in a smart contract. Allowing the message sender to control that corresponding
Stellar account would, therefore, be a catastrophic security failure.

### Incompatible with CAP-0048

This proposal is incompatible with CAP-0048. CAP-0048 depends on the ability to
store a balance in a trustline, but in this proposal the invoker of a smart
contract need not correspond with any Stellar account. As such, it is not
necessarily possible to associate a trustline with the invoker of a smart
contract.

### Compatible with CAP-0049

This proposal is compatible with CAP-0049 subject to the following
clarifications and modifications.

#### WrappedBalanceEntry and WrappedAllowanceEntry Are Owned by Contracts

Both types of ledger entry are owned by contracts, rather than the accounts to
which they are related. Alternatively, we could simply use `ContractDataEntry`
instead.

#### Wrapper Interface: wrap

This proposal removes `wrap` from the "Wrapper Interface" in CAP-0049. Instead,
`WrapAssetOp` is introduced to perform a similar function. This change reflects
the fact that a contract must not reduce the balance of a trustline (see
"Message Sender Does Not Acquire Signing Authority Over a Stellar Account").

The definition of `WrapAssetOp` is

```
struct WrapAssetOp
{
    // address that owns the wrapped asset
    Address address;

    // asset to wrap
    Asset asset;

    // amount of asset to wrap
    int64 amount;
};
```

`WrapAssetOp` is invalid if

- `address.type() == ADDRESS_CONTRACT && address.contract().type() == ASSET_ADAPTOR`
- `asset` is invalid
- `amount <= 0`

The behavior of `WrapAssetOp` is analogous to `wrap` in CAP-0049.

#### Wrapper Interface: unwrap

This proposal changes the signature of `unwrap` from the "Wrapper Interface" in
CAP-0049. The new signature is

```rust
fn unwrap(destination: AccountID, value: uint256) -> bool;
```

which reflects the fact that the destination must now be specified as there is
no direct relation between ownership in contracts and Stellar accounts.

### Extension: Presigned Messages

While this proposal does not need to support presigned messages, it is
instructive to consider how they fit into this model. The key requirements for
presigned messages are

- domain separation: a presigned message should not collide with any transaction
or with any other presigned messages
- usability: a presigned message should be easy to prepare and verify
- performance: a presigned message should be efficient to prepare and verify

To satisfy the above requirements, we introduce the following XDR

```
enum EnvelopeType
{
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_V0 = 0,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCP = 1,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX = 2,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_AUTH = 3,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCPVALUE = 4,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_FEE_BUMP = 5,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_OP_ID = 6,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_POOL_REVOKE_OP_ID = 7,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_INVOKE_SMART_CONTRACT_TX = 8,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_MESSAGE = 9
};

// Presigned message is an Ed25519 signature over the SHA256 hash of
// MessageSignaturePayload
struct MessageSignaturePayload
{
    Hash networkID;
    union switch (EnvelopeType type)
    {
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_MESSAGE:
        SCVal message;
    }
    message;
};
```

This will not collide with any transaction because both are prefixed with the
fixed-length `networkID`, followed by a 4-byte discriminant which will differ
for presigned messages and transactions.

Although this can theoretically collide with other presigned messages, it is
easy for an application to ensure this does not occur. For example, `message`
could contain a vector with the following components

- the verifying contract address
- the domain separator
- the actual message payload

In this case, presigned messages for different contracts would necessarily be
different because the contract address would differ. The domain separator would
prevent collisions between different signed messages for a single contract.

The host interface will have native support for operations on `SCVal` such as
vectors, maps, and strings so it will be efficient to construct the messsage.
The host interface can also support an efficient hash on `SCVal`.

### Extension: More Powerful Contract Interactions

It could be desirable to allow a transaction to do more than just invoke a
specific function on a contract. This could be permitted by adding the following
XDR

```
struct RunWasmTransaction
{
    // sourceAccount pays the fee and provides the sequence number
    AccountID sourceAccount;

    // seqNum to be consumed on sourceAccount
    SequenceNumber seqNum;

    // fee to be paid by sourceAccount
    int64 fee;

    // WASM bytecode
    opaque wasm<>;

    // symbol to look up in wasm
    SCSymbol symbol;

    // list of parameters to pass to function
    SCVal parameters<>;
};

struct RunWasmTransactionEnvelope
{
    // the tx to execute
    RunWasmTransaction tx;

    // signatures over the SHA256 hash of TransactionSignaturePayload
    //
    // used to authorize tx.sourceAccount to pay the fee and provide the
    // sequence number
    DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;

    // signatures over the SHA256 hash of TransactionSignaturePayload
    //
    // used to authorize the invocation of tx.wasm
    //
    // not necessarily related to tx.sourceAccount or any of its signers
    KeyedSignature invokerSignature;
};

enum EnvelopeType
{
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_V0 = 0,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCP = 1,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX = 2,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_AUTH = 3,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCPVALUE = 4,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_FEE_BUMP = 5,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_OP_ID = 6,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_POOL_REVOKE_OP_ID = 7,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_INVOKE_SMART_CONTRACT_TX = 8,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_RUN_WASM_TX = 9
};

union TransactionEnvelope switch (EnvelopeType type)
{
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_V0:
    TransactionV0Envelope v0;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
    TransactionV1Envelope v1;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_FEE_BUMP:
    FeeBumpTransactionEnvelope feeBump;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_INVOKE_SMART_CONTRACT_TX:
    InvokeContractTransactionEnvelope invoke;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_RUN_WASM_TX:
    RunWasmTransactionEnvelope runWasm;
};
```

To run arbitrary WASM, a user will submit a `RunWasmTransactionEnvelope env`
with the following properties:

- `env.tx.seqNum = seqNum(env.tx.sourceAccount) + 1`
- `availableBalance(env.tx.sourceAccount) >= env.tx.fee`
- `env.tx.wasm` is the WASM you want to run
- `env.tx.symbol` is the function you want to call in the WASM module
- `env.tx.parameters` are the parameters you want to pass to the function
- `env.signatures` are valid signatures for signers of `env.tx.sourceAccount`
with total weight exceeding `lowThreshold(env.tx.sourceAccount)`
- `env.invokerSignature.signature` is a valid signature for
`env.invokerSignature.key`

Immediately after the WASM begins execution, a call to `get_invoker()` will
return `env.invokerSignature.key`.
