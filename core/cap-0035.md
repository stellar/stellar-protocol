Title: Asset Clawback
Working Group:
    Owner: Tomer Weller <@tomerweller>
    Authors: Dan Doney (Securrency, Inc.), Tomer Weller <@tomerweller>, Leigh McCulloch <@leighmcculloch>
    Consulted: Nicolas Barry <@MonsieurNicolas>, Jon Jove <@jonjove>, Bartek Nowotarski <@bartekn>
Status: Draft
Created: 2020-12-14
Discussion: https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/hPhkXhrl5-Y/m/ZF6eJcqKAgAJ
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary

This proposal provides the Issuer with a means to clawback (and reissue if desired)
assets in order to support regulatory requirements. This function can be used to: 

1) recover assets that have been fraudulently obtained 
2) respond to regulatory actions, if required 
3) enable identity proofed persons to recover an enabled asset
in the event of loss of key custody or theft. 

The proposal does not involve shared
custody of the person’s account and does not affect custody of bearer assets in 
the persons account.

## Working Group

This protocol change was initially authored by Dan Doney and Tomer Weller. The working group include other authors and the consulted persons include key individuals familiar with the implementation of the core protocol and maintainers of Horizon and its SDKs.

## Motivation

In order to meet securities regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions globally, 
the issuer (or designated transfer agent) must be able to demonstrate the ability 
to revoke assets in the event of a mistaken or fraudulent transaction or other 
regulatory action regarding a specific person or asset wide. To receive approval, 
the Issuer must demonstrate the ability to perform this action with or without the 
permission of the affected person. Unlike approaches that involve multiple 
signatures on the person’s wallet (brokerage clawback), this approach does not 
compromise the custody of other assets in the person’s wallet. Additionally, this 
approach is an improvement over an approach that invalidates the trustline. While 
trustline invalidation freezes assets, tokens (asset shares) remain in circulation 
compromising accounting models. The approach has other benefits to owners of the 
affected asset including the ability to recover assets if wallet custody is lost 
including the important business continuity mitigations in the loss of control of 
custodial or omnibus account.

### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should be secure and reliable.

- The Stellar Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via 
exchange of assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments between 
assets in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.

## Abstract
This proposal introduces a new `ClawbackOp` operation. The `AUTH_REVOCABLE`
flag on the issuing account must be set to authorize a `ClawbackOp` operation
submitted by the Issuing account.  The `ClawbackOp` operation results in the
removal of the specified assets issued from the designated account. The
`ClawbackOp` operation only applies to assets issued by the source account.
Assets that are revocable can be easily distinguished from traditional
blockchain assets (bearer instruments) so that asset owners are aware of rights.
The transaction may result in revocation of some or all of the specified assets
from the designated account based on the amount provided in the `ClawbackOp`
operation.

### Semantics

Clawback operates similar to auth revocation in that it takes an amount of the
asset out of active circulation by preventing the account from using it on the
network. Auth revocation freezes the full balance of an asset in an account, but
clawback provides fine grain control and allows the issuer to take out of the
account and destroy a specific amount of the asset. 

In order to execute a clawback, an issuer account must have its `AUTH_REVOCABLE`
flag set. Once set, the issuer submits a `ClawbackOp` operation specifying the
`from` account containing the asset to be clawed back. This operation does not
require the affected account’s signature. The transaction results in a change in
balance to the recipient’s account. The amount of the asset clawed back is
burned and is not sent to any other address. The issuer may reissue the asset to
the same account or to another account if the intent of the clawback is to move
the asset to another account.

#### Account

This proposal uses the existing `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag in the issuer account
`AccountFlags`. Existing behavior and meaning of the flag is unchanged.

#### Clawback Operation

The `ClawbackOp` operation reduces the balance of the asset in the account by
the specified amount of the specific `asset` from the `from` account,
effectively returning it to the issuer account, burning it.

Similar to other operations the clawback operation will fail if the account
balance is less than the amount specified when account for selling liabilities.
If clawback is required of asset amounts locked up with selling liabilities then
the issuer may use the `AllowTrustOp` operation to revoke authorization of the
trustline, which will cancel any existing ledger entries creating selling
liabilities, such as offers, and issue the `ClawbackOp` in the same transaction.
If the issuer wishes to allow the `from` account to continue utilizing the asset
it can include another `AllowTrustOp` after the `ClawbackOp` to authorize the
account once again.

Similar to the limitations of the `AllowTrustOp`'s ability to revoke a trustline
for an asset, the `ClawbackOp` can only affect a trustline held in an account,
and not an asset held in a `BalanceEntry`.

The clawback operation requires a medium threshold signature to authorize the
operation.

Possible return values for the `ClawbackOp` are:
- `CLAWBACK_SUCCESS` if the clawback is successful.
- `CLAWBACK_MALFORMED` if the `asset` value is malformed or `amount` is < 1.
- `CLAWBACK_NO_TRUST` if the `from` account does not have a trustline for
  `asset`.
- `CLAWBACK_NOT_REVOCABLE` if the `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag is not set on the issuer
  account.
- `CLAWBACK_UNDERFUNDED` if the `from` account does not have sufficient
  available balance of `asset` after accounting for selling liabilities.

## Design Rationale

In the event of regulatory action, erroneous transaction, or loss of custody,
the issuer may conduct a clawback transaction if the `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag is 
set. In the event of loss of custody, the affected party would need to 
demonstrate they are the rightful owner of the account (usually through 
reproofing KYC credentials or otherwise authenticating). On obtaining this 
proof, the issuer could execute a clawback from the lost account followed by a
subsequent payment to a separate account under control of the affected party. 
Needless to say, executing a reallocation is a significant responsibility and 
in many cases should be reserved for licensed entities (like a transfer agent) 
holding the issuer credentials and aware of responsibilities under the law of 
the jurisdiction of the affected party and asset. 
 
### Reusing the AUTH_REVOCABLE flag

The account `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag allows the issuer to indicate that it has
control over the use of the asset on the network. By including the
`AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag in account flags, account owners may review the
revocability of an asset issued by the issuer and have the choice to avoid this
type of asset if they object to the implied trust in the issuer. Clawback is
another form of an issuer revoking use of an asset with fine control over the
exact amount that the issuer is taking out of active circulation.

### Threshold

The clawback operation requires a medium threshold signature because it is
changing the balance of an account and is more aligned with impact of a payment
operation than an allow trust operation.

### Claimable Balances

Claimable balances are already not revokable, so it seems consistent to not add
functionality that allows them to be clawed back. We could explore additional
changes to make claimable balances always claimable by their issuer if the
issuer has the `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag set. This problem is not solved by this
proposal, but introduces nothing that prevents that functionality from being
added in a future proposal. Any issuer issuing assets under strict regulation
where claimable balances that cannot be clawed back are desireable could use
`AUTHORIZED_TO_MAINTAIN_LIABILITIES_FLAG`, introduced in CAP-18, and SEP-8 to
approve individual transactions and prevent the creation of a claimable balance.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

### Backwards Incompatibilities

The change does not have an affect on previous assets, accounts, or transaction 
structure. It should not cause a breaking change in existing implementations. 

The new operations introduced are all reversable meaning that their use if
reversed has no impact on existing pre-signed or pre-authorized transactions
involving the asset and the account that the clawback operates on.
