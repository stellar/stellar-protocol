CAP: 0035
Title: Asset Clawback
Author: Dan Doney
Status: Proposed
Created: 2020-09-29
Discussion: https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/hPhkXhrl5-Y/m/ZF6eJcqKAgAJ
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary

This proposal provides the Issuer with a means to clawback (and reissue if desired)
assets in order to support regulatory requirements. This function can be used to: 

1) recover assets that have been fraudulently obtained 
2) respond to regulatory actions, if required 
3) enable identity proofed persons to recover an enabled asset
in the event of loss of key custody or theft. 

The proposal does not involve shared
custody of the person’s account and does not affect custody of bearer assets in 
the persons account.

## Motivation

In order to meet securities regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions globally, 
the issuer (or designated transfer agent) must be able to demonstrate the ability 
to revoke assets in the event of a mistaken or fraudulent transaction or other 
regulatory action regarding a specific person or asset wide. To receive approval, 
the Issuer must demonstrate the ability to perform this action with or without the 
permission of the affected person. Unlike approaches that involve multiple 
signatures on the person’s wallet (brokerage clawback), this approach does not 
compromise the custody of other assets in the person’s wallet. Additionally, this 
approach is an improvement over an approach that invalidates the trustline. While 
trustline invalidation freezes assets, tokens (asset shares) remain in circulation 
compromising accounting models. The approach has other benefits to owners of the 
affected asset including the ability to recover assets if wallet custody is lost 
including the important business continuity mitigations in the loss of control of 
custodial or omnibus account.

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should be secure and reliable.

- The Stellar Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via 
exchange of assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments between 
assets in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.

## Abstract

This proposal adds a new flag to the Issuing account and introduces a new CLAWBACK 
operation. The `CLAWBACK_ENABLED` flag on the issuing account must be set to 
authorize a `CLAWBACK` operation submitted by the Issuing account.  The `CLAWBACK` 
operation results in the removal of the specified assets issued from the 
designated account. The `CLAWBACK` operation only applies to assets issued by the 
source account. Assets with clawback enabled can be easily distinguished from 
traditional blockchain assets (bearer instruments) so that asset owners are aware 
of rights. The transaction may result in revocation of some or all of the specified 
assets from the designated account based on the amount provided in the `CLAWBACK` 
operation. In a future proposal, we will outline an approach by which the same flag 
can be used to execute a ROLLBACK of a transaction (within a designated time window) 
in the event of a fraudulent or mistaken transaction.

## Specification

### Account changes
This proposal requires the addition of `CLAWBACK_ENABLED` to the issuing account 
AccountFlags so the XDR becomes
 
```c
enum AccountFlags
{
    AUTH_IMMUTABLE = 1,                                      
    AUTH_REQUIRED = 2,                                  
    AUTH_REVOCABLE = 4,                                  
    CLAWBACK_ENABLED = 8                                  
};
```
 
In order to execute a clawback, the Issuer submits a  a `CLAWBACK` operation 
from the account containing the asset to be clawed back to the desired 
destination. This operation does not require the affected account’s signature. 
The transaction results in a change in balance to the recipient’s account. 
 
### Clawback Operation Specification
Clawback operation pulls back the specified amount of a specific asset from 
the designated account, effectively burning it.

The following XDR changes are required:

```c
struct ClawbackOp 
{
    union switch (AssetType type)
    {
    // ASSET_TYPE_NATIVE is not allowed
    case ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM4:
        AssetCode4 assetCode4;
    case ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM12:
        AssetCode12 assetCode12;
    } asset; // asset code to claw back. asset issuer is implied from source account.  
    MuxedAccount from;
    int64 amount;
}
 
enum ClawbackResultCode
{
    // codes considered as "success" for the operation
    CLAWBACK_SUCCESS = 0, // CLAWBACK successfuly completed
 
    // codes considered as "failure" for the operation
    CLAWBACK_MALFORMED = -1, // asset code is malformed or amount is < 1
    CLAWBACK_NO_TRUST = -2,       // no trust line on source account
    CLAWBACK_DISABLED = -3, // CLAWBACK_ENABLED flag is off on the issuer account 
    CLAWBACK_UNDERFUNDED = -4, // trustline balance is less than amount to clawback 
};
 
enum OperationType
{
    CREATE_ACCOUNT = 0,
    ...
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP = 18,
    CLAWBACK = 19
};
 
struct Operation
{
 
    MuxedAccount* sourceAccount;
 
    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    case CREATE_ACCOUNT:
        CreateAccountOp createAccountOp;
    ...
    case REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP:
        RevokeSponsorshipOp revokeSponsorshipOp;
    case CLAWBACK:
    	ClawbackOp clawbackOp;
    }
 
    body;
};
``` 
 
The account CLAWBACK_ENABLED flag allows the issuer to designate the asset as a
non-bearer instrument asset. By including the CLAWBACK_ENABLED flag in Asset 
flags, Account owners may review the revocability of an asset and have the 
choice to avoid this type of asset if they object to the implied trust in the 
issuer.  

## Design Rationale

How can this new flag be used?
In the event of regulatory action, erroneous transaction, or loss of custody,
the issuer may conduct a clawback transaction if the `CLAWBACK_ENABLED` flag is 
set. In the event of loss of custody, the affected party would need to 
demonstrate they are the rightful owner of the account (usually through 
reproofing KYC credentials or otherwise authenticating). On obtaining this 
proof, the issuer could execute a clawback from the lost account followed by a
subsequent payment to a separate account under control of the affected party. 
Needless to say, executing a reallocation is a significant responsibility and 
in many cases should be reserved for licensed entities (like a transfer agent) 
holding the issuer credentials and aware of responsibilities under the law of 
the jurisdiction of the affected party and asset. 
 

## Backwards Incompatibilities

The change does not have an affect on previous assets, accounts, or transaction 
structure. It should not cause a breaking change in existing implementations. 
 
## Pending orders

Clawback will cancel as many pending orders as necessary, in order of creation, 
to ensure that account liabilities are maintained.

## Test Cases

None yet.
