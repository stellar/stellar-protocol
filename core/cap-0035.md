CAP: 0035
Title: Asset Clawback
Working Group:
    Owner: Tomer Weller <@tomerweller>
    Authors: Dan Doney (Securrency, Inc.), Tomer Weller <@tomerweller>, Leigh McCulloch <@leighmcculloch>, Siddarth Suresh <@sisuresh>
    Consulted: Nicolas Barry <@MonsieurNicolas>, Jon Jove <@jonjove>, Bartek Nowotarski <@bartekn>
Status: Draft
Created: 2020-12-14
Discussion: https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/hPhkXhrl5-Y/m/ZF6eJcqKAgAJ
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary

This proposal provides the Issuer with a means to clawback (and reissue if desired)
assets in order to support regulatory requirements. This function can be used to: 

1) recover assets that have been fraudulently obtained 
2) respond to regulatory actions, if required 
3) enable identity proofed persons to recover an enabled asset
in the event of loss of key custody or theft. 

The proposal does not involve shared
custody of the person’s account and does not affect custody of bearer assets in 
the persons account.

## Working Group

This protocol change was initially authored by Dan Doney and Tomer Weller. The working group include other authors and the consulted persons include key individuals familiar with the implementation of the core protocol and maintainers of Horizon and its SDKs.

## Motivation

In order to meet securities regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions globally, 
the issuer (or designated transfer agent) must be able to demonstrate the ability 
to revoke assets in the event of a mistaken or fraudulent transaction or other 
regulatory action regarding a specific person or asset wide. To receive approval, 
the Issuer must demonstrate the ability to perform this action with or without the 
permission of the affected person. Unlike approaches that involve multiple 
signatures on the person’s wallet (brokerage clawback), this approach does not 
compromise the custody of other assets in the person’s wallet. Additionally, this 
approach is an improvement over an approach that invalidates the trustline. While 
trustline invalidation freezes assets, tokens (asset shares) remain in circulation 
compromising accounting models. The approach has other benefits to owners of the 
affected asset including the ability to recover assets if wallet custody is lost 
including the important business continuity mitigations in the loss of control of 
custodial or omnibus account.

### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should be secure and reliable.

- The Stellar Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via 
exchange of assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments between 
assets in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.

## Abstract
This proposal introduces a new `ClawbackOp` operation. The `AUTH_REVOCABLE`
flag on the issuing account must be set to authorize a `ClawbackOp` operation
submitted by the Issuing account.  The `ClawbackOp` operation results in the
removal of the specified assets issued from the designated account. The
`ClawbackOp` operation only applies to assets issued by the source account.
Assets that are revocable can be easily distinguished from traditional
blockchain assets (bearer instruments) so that asset owners are aware of rights.
The transaction may result in revocation of some or all of the specified assets
from the designated account based on the amount provided in the `ClawbackOp`
operation.

## Specification

### XDR changes

This patch of XDR changes is based on the XDR files in tag/commit `v15.1.0` (`90b2780584c6390207bf09291212d606896ce9f8`) of [stellar-core].

### Semantics

Clawback operates similar to auth revocation in that it takes an amount of the
asset out of active circulation by preventing the account from using it on the
network. Auth revocation freezes the full balance of an asset in an account, but
clawback provides fine grain control and allows the issuer to take out of the
account and destroy a specific amount of the asset. 

In order to execute a clawback of an amount in an account, an issuer account
must have its `AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` flag set when the account holding
the asset created its trustline. The issuer submits a `ClawbackOp` operation
specifying the `from` account containing the asset to be clawed back. This
operation does not require the affected account’s signature. The transaction
results in a change in balance to the recipient’s accoun. The amount of the
asset clawed back is burned and is not sent to any other address. The issuer
may reissue the asset to the same account or to another account if the intent
of the clawback is to move the asset to another account.

In order to execute a clawback of a claimable balance, the claimable balance
must have been created with the issuer account included as a claimant with an
unconditional clawback predicate. An account that creates a trustline for the
asset while the issuer account has its `AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` flag set
is required to include the issuer as a claimant with an unconditional
clawback predicate of any claimable balance it creates.

#### Account

This proposal introduces a new flag to accounts,
`AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG`. When the flag is set, trustlines created
inherit the flag and the balances within those trustlines may be clawed back
by the issuer.

An account may set or unset the flag using the existing `SetOptionsOp`
operation, unless the `AUTH_IMMUTABLE_FLAG` flag is set, in the same way that
existing `AUTH_*` flags may be set or unset unless the immutable flag is set.

#### Trustline

This proposal introduces a new flag to trustlines, `CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG`,
that is set at the time the trustline is created if the issuer account of the
asset of the trustline has its `AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` flag set.

No functionality to change the flag is supplied.

If the new flag is set it indicates that the balance held by the trustline
can be clawed back by the issuer using the `ClawbackOp`, and that any
claimable balance created by the account must have the issuer account
included as an claimaint with an unconditional predicate.

#### Clawback Operation

This proposal introduces the `ClawbackOp` operation. The `ClawbackOp`
operation reduces the balance of the asset in the account by the specified
amount of the specific `asset` from the `from` account, effectively returning
it to the issuer account, burning it.

Similar to other operations the clawback operation will fail if the account
balance is less than the amount specified when account for selling liabilities.
If clawback is required of asset amounts locked up with selling liabilities then
the issuer may use the `AllowTrustOp` operation to revoke authorization of the
trustline, which will cancel any existing ledger entries creating selling
liabilities, such as offers, and issue the `ClawbackOp` in the same transaction.
If the issuer wishes to allow the `from` account to continue utilizing the asset
it can include another `AllowTrustOp` after the `ClawbackOp` to authorize the
account once again.

Similar to the limitations of the `AllowTrustOp`'s ability to revoke a trustline
for an asset, the `ClawbackOp` can only affect a trustline held in an account,
and not an asset held in a `BalanceEntry`.

The clawback operation requires a medium threshold signature to authorize the
operation.

Possible return values for the `ClawbackOp` are:
- `CLAWBACK_SUCCESS` if the clawback is successful.
- `CLAWBACK_MALFORMED` if the `asset` value is malformed or `amount` is < 1.
- `CLAWBACK_NO_TRUST` if the `from` account does not have a trustline for
  `asset`.
- `CLAWBACK_NOT_REVOCABLE` if the `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag is not set on the issuer
  account.
- `CLAWBACK_UNDERFUNDED` if the `from` account does not have sufficient
  available balance of `asset` after accounting for selling liabilities.

#### Create Claimable Balance Operation

This proposal introduces a new failure case in the execution of the
`CreateClaimableBalanceOp`. If the source account of the operation has a
trustline to the asset with the `CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` flag set, the
operation will fail with `CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_CLAWBACK_REQUIRED` if one
of the `claimants` `destination` is not the issuer account of the asset, or
if the issuer account is a claimant and the `predicate` is not
`CLAIM_PREDICATE_UNCONDITIONAL_CLAWBACK`.

#### Clawback Claimable Balance Operation

This proposal introduces the `ClawbackClaimableBalanceOp` operation. The
`ClawbackClaimableBalanceOp` operation destroys a claimable balance,
effectively returning the asset to the issuer account, burning it.

The operation will only succeed if the claimable balance has in its
`claimants` a claimant with:
- its `destination` set to the issuer account.
- and, its `predicate` set to include `UNCONDITIONAL_CLAWBACK`.

The operation source account must be the issuer account of the asset held in
the claimable balance.

The operation requires a medium threshold signature to authorize the
operation.

Possible return values for the `ClawbackClaimableBalanceOp` are:
- `CLAWBACK_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS` if the clawback is successful.
- `CLAWBACK_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_MALFORMED` if the `claimableBalanceId` value is
  malformed.
- `CLAWBACK_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NOT_ISSUER` if the source account is the not
  the issuer of the asset.
- `CLAWBACK_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NOT_CLAWBACK_ENABLED` if the claimants do not
  include the source account with the `UNCONDITIONAL_CLAWBACK` predicate.

## Design Rationale

In the event of regulatory action, erroneous transaction, or loss of custody,
the issuer may conduct a clawback transaction if the `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag is 
set. In the event of loss of custody, the affected party would need to 
demonstrate they are the rightful owner of the account (usually through 
reproofing KYC credentials or otherwise authenticating). On obtaining this 
proof, the issuer could execute a clawback from the lost account followed by a
subsequent payment to a separate account under control of the affected party. 
Needless to say, executing a reallocation is a significant responsibility and 
in many cases should be reserved for licensed entities (like a transfer agent) 
holding the issuer credentials and aware of responsibilities under the law of 
the jurisdiction of the affected party and asset. 
 
### Flags and Trustlines

The account `AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` flag allows the issuer to indicate
that it has control over the use of the asset on the network. By including
the flag in account flags, account owners may review the revocability of an
asset issued by the issuer and have the choice to avoid this type of asset if
they object to the implied trust in the issuer. By setting the
`CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` flag on the trustline, account owners have confidence
that the clawback feature may not be enabled if it was not enabled when they
created their trustline.

### Threshold

The clawback operations require a medium threshold signature because they are
changing the balance of accounts changing the states of claimable balances
and is more aligned with impact of a payment operation than an allow trust
operation.

### Claimable Balances

Claimable balances are immutable and so any functionality to clawback a
claimable balance is all or nothing. The clawback feature of claimable
balances is proposed with the addition of a claimant to make the clawback
capability explicit. A separate operation is specified to ensure that
clawback is transparent and highly visible in comparison to routine claiming
of a claimable balance and to allow issuers that use claimable balances
routinely to distinguish between claimable balances they can routinely claim
and claimable balances they may clawback.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

### Backwards Incompatibilities

The change does not have an affect on previous assets, accounts, or transaction 
structure. It should not cause a breaking change in existing implementations. 

Pre-authorized, pre-signed, or pre-planned transactions that create accounts,
and create claimable balances, using assets that become clawback enabled
could fail if those transactions did not include the issuer account as a
claimant.

The new operations introduced are all reversible meaning that their use if
