CAP: 0023
Title: Two-Part Payments with ClaimableBalanceEntry
Author: Jonathan Jove
Status: Draft
Created: 2019-06-04
Updated: 2019-12-23
Discussion: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/303
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary
Payments can fail depending on the state of the destination account. This
proposal introduces new operations that separate sending a payment from
receiving the payment. Then the success of sending depends only on the state of
the sending account and success of receiving depends only on the state of the
receiving account.

## Motivation
This proposal seeks to solve the following problem: it should be easy to send a
payment to an account that is not necessarily prepared to receive the payment.
There are several manifestations of this problem, the two most important being

1. it should be easy for protocols (like an implementation of payment channels)
to pay out to participants, and
2. it should be easy for issuers to issue assets non-interactively.

### Goals Alignment
This proposal is aligned with several Stellar Network Goals, among them:

- The Stellar Network should facilitate simplicity and interoperability with
  other protocols and networks.
- The Stellar Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via
  exchange of assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments
  between assets in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.
    - In support of this, the Stellar Network should enable asset issuance, but
      as a means of enabling cross-border payments.

## Abstract
We introduce `ClaimableBalanceEntry` as a new type of `LedgerEntry` which
represents the transfer of ownership of some amount of an asset.
`CreateClaimableBalance` and `ClaimClaimableBalance` enable the temporal
separation of initiating and receiving a payment, respectively. This will
facilitate protocols built on the Stellar network by providing a mechanism for
payments that never fail. Existing proposals, such as those for deterministic
accounts, can provide a similar mechanism but are not able to handle
authorization restricted assets as easily. A specific and simple protocol that
will be facilitated is the asset issuance protocol that creates an account for
another party and issues an asset to that account.

## Specification

### XDR
First, we introduce `ClaimableBalanceEntry` and the corresponding changes for
`LedgerEntryType` and `LedgerEntry`.
```c++
enum LedgerEntryType
{
    // ... ACCOUNT, TRUSTLINE, OFFER, unchanged ...
    DATA = 3,
    CLAIMABLE_BALANCE = 4
};

enum ClaimPredicateType
{
    CLAIM_PREDICATE_UNCONDITIONAL = 0,
    CLAIM_PREDICATE_BEFORE_ABSOLUTE_TIME = 1,
    CLAIM_PREDICATE_AFTER_ABSOLUTE_TIME = 2,
    CLAIM_PREDICATE_BEFORE_RELATIVE_TIME = 3,
    CLAIM_PREDICATE_AFTER_RELATIVE_TIME = 4
};

union ClaimPredicate switch (ClaimPredicateType type)
{
case CLAIM_PREDICATE_UNCONDITIONAL:
    void;
case CLAIM_PREDICATE_BEFORE_ABSOLUTE_TIME:
    Timepoint absBefore;
case CLAIM_PREDICATE_AFTER_ABSOLUTE_TIME:
    Timepoint absAfter;
case CLAIM_PREDICATE_BEFORE_RELATIVE_TIME:
    uint64 relBefore;    // Seconds since closeTime of the ledger in which the
                         // ClaimableBalanceEntry was created
case CLAIM_PREDICATE_AFTER_RELATIVE_TIME:
    uint64 relAfter;     // Seconds since closeTime of the ledger in which the
                         // ClaimableBalanceEntry was created
};

struct ClaimCondition
{
    AccountID destination;    // The account that can use this condition
    uint32 weight;            // Cannot exceed 255, analogous to signer weight
    ClaimPredicate predicate; // Contributes weight if predicate is satisfied
};

enum ClaimableBalanceIDType
{
    CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_ID_TYPE_V0 = 0
};

union ClaimableBalanceID switch (ClaimableBalanceIDType type)
{
case CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_ID_TYPE_V0:
    Hash v0;
};

struct ClaimableBalanceEntry
{
    // Unique identifier for this ClaimableBalanceEntry
    ClaimableBalanceID balanceID;

    // List of weighted conditions for destination accounts to claim
    ClaimCondition condition<10>;

    // Total weight of satisfied conditions for destination account to claim
    // Cannot exceed 255
    uint32 threshold;

    // Amount of native asset to pay the reserve as of the ledger when this
    // ClaimableBalanceEntry was created
    int64 reserve;

    // Any asset including native
    Asset asset;

    // Amount of asset
    int64 amount;

    // Set the authorization level for destination account trust line to
    // authorize if it is less than authorize
    uint32 authorize;

    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};

struct LedgerEntry
{
    uint32 lastModifiedLedgerSeq; // ledger the LedgerEntry was last changed

    union switch (LedgerEntryType type)
    {
    // ... ACCOUNT, TRUSTLINE, OFFER, DATA unchanged ...
    case CLAIMABLE_BALANCE:
        ClaimableBalanceEntry balance;
    }
    data;

    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};
```

Second, we introduce the new operations `CreateClaimableBalanceOp`,
`ClaimClaimableBalanceOp`, and `AuthorizeClaimableBalanceOp` as well as the
corresponding changes to `OperationType` and `Operation`.
```c++
enum OperationType
{
    // ... CREATE_ACCOUNT, ..., MANAGE_BUY_OFFER unchanged ...
    PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND = 13,
    CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE = 14,
    CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE = 15,
    AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE = 16
};

struct CreateClaimableBalanceOp
{
    Asset asset;
    int64 amount;
    ClaimCondition condition<10>;
    uint32 threshold;
};

struct ClaimClaimableBalanceOp
{
    Hash balanceID;
};

struct AuthorizeClaimableBalanceOp
{
    Hash balanceID;
    TrustLineFlags authorize;
};

struct Operation
{
    // sourceAccount is the account used to run the operation
    // if not set, the runtime defaults to "sourceAccount" specified at
    // the transaction level
    AccountID* sourceAccount;

    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACOUNT, ..., PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND unchanged ...
    case CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE:
        CreateClaimableBalanceOp createClaimableBalanceOp;
    case CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE:
        ClaimClaimableBalanceOp claimClaimableBalanceOp;
    case AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE:
        AuthorizeClaimableBalanceOp authorizeClaimableBalanceOp;
    }
    body;
};
```

Third, we introduce the result types `CreateClaimableBalanceResult`,
`ClaimClaimableBalanceResult`, and `AuthorizeClaimableBalanceResult` as well as
the corresponding changes to `OperationResult`.
```c++
enum CreateClaimableBalanceResultCode
{
    CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS = 0,
    CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_MALFORMED = -1,
    CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED = -2,
    CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_LOW_RESERVE = -3,
    CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_UNDERFUNDED = -4
};

union CreateClaimableBalanceResult switch (CreateClaimableBalanceResultCode code)
{
case CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS:
    void;
default:
    void;
};

enum ClaimClaimableBalanceResultCode
{
    CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS = 0,
    CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST = -1,
    CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_CANNOT_CLAIM = -2
    CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_LOW_RESERVE = -3,
    CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED = -4,
    CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_LINE_FULL = -5
};

union ClaimClaimableBalanceResult switch (ClaimClaimableBalanceResultCode code)
{
case CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS:
    void;
default:
    void;
};

enum AuthorizeClaimableBalanceResultCode
{
    AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS = 0,
    AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST = -1,
    AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NOT_ISSUER = -2,
    AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_TRUST_NOT_REQUIRED = -3,
    AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_CANNOT_REVOKE = -4
};

union AuthorizeClaimableBalanceResult switch (AuthorizeClaimableBalanceResultCode code)
{
case AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS:
    void;
default:
    void;
};

union OperationResult switch (OperationResultCode code)
{
case opINNER:
    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACOUNT, ..., PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND unchanged ...
    case CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE:
        CreateClaimableBalanceResult createClaimableBalanceResult;
    case CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE:
        ClaimClaimableBalanceResult claimClaimableBalanceResult;
    case AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE:
        AuthorizeClaimableBalanceResult authorizeClaimableBalanceResult;
    }
    tr;
default:
    void;
};
```

### Semantics

### CreateClaimableBalanceOp
A `ClaimableBalanceEntry` can only be created by the `CreateClaimableBalanceOp`
operation. `CreateClaimableBalanceOp` is invalid with
`CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_MALFORMED` if

- `asset` is invalid
- `amount` is non-positive
- `threshold` is not between 1 and 255 (inclusive)
- `weight` on any `condition` is not between 1 and 255 (inclusive)

The behavior of `CreateClaimableBalanceOp` is as follows:

1. Fail with `CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_LOW_RESERVE` if the `sourceAccount` does
   not have at least `min(1, condition.size()-1) * baseReserve` available
   balance of native asset (see CAP-0003)
2. Deduct `min(1, condition.size()-1) * baseReserve` of native asset from
   `sourceAccount`
3. Fail with `CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NO_TRUST` if the `sourceAccount` does not
   have a trust line for `asset`
4. Fail with `CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED` if the `sourceAccount` is
   not authorized for `asset`
5. Fail with `CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_UNDERFUNDED` if the `sourceAccount` does
   not have at least `amount` available balance of `asset`
6. Deduct `amount` of `asset` from `sourceAccount`
7. Create a balance entry with the following properties:
    - `balanceID` of type `CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_ID_TYPE_V0`. `balanceID.v0()` equal
       to the SHA256 hash of the concatenation of the `sourceAccount` of the
       transaction, the `seqNum` of the transaction, and the index of this
       operation in the transaction
    - `condition` as specified in the operation, with the exception that
        - `CLAIM_PREDICATE_BEFORE_RELATIVE_TIME` will be converted to
          `CLAIM_PREDICATE_BEFORE_ABSOLUTE_TIME` by adding `relBefore` to the
          `closeTime` in the `LedgerHeader`
        - `CLAIM_PREDICATE_BEFORE_RELATIVE_TIME` will be converted to
          `CLAIM_PREDICATE_AFTER_ABSOLUTE_TIME` by adding `relAfter` to the
          `closeTime` in the `LedgerHeader`
    - `threshold` as specified in the operation
    - `reserve` equal to `min(1, condition.size()-1) * baseReserve`
    - `asset` as specified in the operation
    - `amount` as specified in the operation
    - `authorize` equal to 0
8. Succeed with `CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS`

`CreateClaimableBalanceOp` requires medium threshold because it can be used to
send funds.

### ClaimClaimableBalanceOp
A `ClaimableBalanceEntry` can only be deleted by the `ClaimClaimableBalanceOp`
operation. `ClaimClaimableBalanceOp` cannot be malformed. The behavior of
`ClaimClaimableBalanceOp` is as follows:

1. Fail with `CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` if there is no
   `ClaimableBalanceEntry` matching `balanceID`.
2. Calculate the total weight of `condition` with `destination = sourceAccount`
   and satisfied predicates.
3. Fail with `CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_CANNOT_CLAIM` if the total weight is less
   than `threshold`.
4. Fail with `CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_LINE_FULL` if the `sourceAccount` does not
   have at least `reserve` available limit of native asset (see CAP-0003)
5. Add `reserve` of native asset to the `sourceAccount`
6. Skip to step 14 if `asset` is native
7. Skip to step 16 if `sourceAccount` is the issuer for `asset`
8. Skip to step 12 if `sourceAccount` has a trust line for `asset`
9. Fail with `opTOO_MANY_SUBENTRIES` if `sourceAccount` is already at the
   subentry limit
10. Fail with `CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_LOW_RESERVE` if the `sourceAccount` does
    not have sufficient available balance (see CAP-0003) to create a trust line
11. Create a trust line with the following properties:
    - `sourceAccount` as specified in the operation
    - `asset` as specified in the `ClaimableBalanceEntry`
    - `balance = 0`
    - `limit = INT64_MAX`
    - `flags = 0`
12. Set `flags = authorize` if `flags < authorize`
13. Fail with `CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED` if `flags = 0` or
    `flags = AUTHORIZED_TO_MAINTAIN_LIABILITIES` and `authorize = 0`
14. Fail with `CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_LINE_FULL` if the `sourceAccount` does
    not have at least `amount` available limit of `asset`
15. Add `amount` of `asset` to the `sourceAccount`
16. Delete the `ClaimableBalanceEntry`
17. Succeed with `CLAIM_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS`

`ClaimClaimableBalanceOp` requires medium threshold because it can be used to
create a trust line.

### AuthorizeClaimableBalanceOp
The `authorize` flag of a `ClaimableBalanceEntry` can be set with
`AuthorizeClaimableBalanceOp`. `AuthorizeClaimableBalanceOp` cannot be
malformed. The behavior of `AuthorizeClaimableBalanceOp` is as follows:

1. Fail with `AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` if there is no
   `ClaimableBalanceEntry` matching `balanceID`.
2. Fail with `AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_NOT_ISSUER` if the `sourceAccount` is
   not the issuer of `asset`
3. Fail with `AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_TRUST_NOT_REQUIRED` if the `asset` is
   not `AUTH_REQUIRED`
4. Fail with `AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_CANNOT_REVOKE` if the `asset` is not
   `AUTH_REVOCABLE` and `authorize < ClaimableBalanceEntry.authorize`
5. Set `authorize` as specified in the operation
6. Succeed with `AUTHORIZE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE_SUCCESS`

`AuthorizeClaimableBalanceOp` requires low threshold because it can only be used
to authorize a trust line.

## Design Rationale

### ClaimableBalanceEntry is not a sub-entry
Each `ClaimableBalanceEntry` exists as an independent entity on the ledger. It
is clear that a `ClaimableBalanceEntry` cannot be a sub-entry of any of its
potential claimants, because any account can be specified as a potential
claimant and it is a security risk for accounts to be able to add sub-entries to
other accounts. But why should the `ClaimableBalanceEntry` be an independent
entity on the ledger rather than a sub-entry of the account that created it?
There are three main benefits of this design:

1. Sending accounts are not limited in the number of payments they can initiate
2. Sending accounts can be merged even if they initiated payments that have not
   been claimed
3. Receiving accounts always receive the reserve from the claimed
   `ClaimableBalanceEntry`

The third benefit facilitates a desirable optimization in which a
`ClaimableBalanceEntry` can be directly converted into a `TrustLine`. This is
useful in some asset issuance workflows where the issuer wants to pay for the
trust line but does not want the recipient to spend the funds prior to creating
the trust line. Of course if the base reserve were raised after the
`ClaimableBalanceEntry` was created then the reserve received would not be
sufficient to pay for the trust line, but they would at least still receive the
reserve. But if the `ClaimableBalanceEntry` were a sub-entry of the sending
account and the base reserve were raised such that the sending account no longer
satisfies the reserve requirement then the receiving account would receive no
reserve (because accounts that do not satisfy the reserve requirement cannot
have their native balance decrease). While this is an unlikely edge case, it
does simplify the behavior of `ClaimableBalanceEntry` by guaranteeing that the
receiving account always receives both the reserve and the amount of asset.

### ClaimableBalanceEntry claimants are accounts
For each `ClaimableBalanceEntry`, `condition` contains a finite and immutable
list of accounts that could potentially claim the `ClaimableBalanceEntry`. Even
if the conditions are satisfiable (which is not guaranteed), it is still
possible for the `ClaimableBalanceEntry` to become stranded. If all of the
accounts listed in `condition` are merged and none of the private keys are
known, then the `ClaimableBalanceEntry` will no longer be claimable.

Suppose that we try to relax this requirement in order to avoid this downside.
We could instead make `condition` contain a finite and immutable list of public
keys. The operation to claim the `ClaimableBalanceEntry` could then contain a
signature over the tuple `(sourceAccount, balanceID)`. If the signature was not
from one of the public keys that satisfy the conditions, then the operation
would fail. This would allow the appropriate party to claim the
`ClaimableBalanceEntry` into any account that they control. But this would also
make it considerably easier to circumvent authorization restrictions on assets.
For instance, an authorized account could create a `ClaimableBalanceEntry` with
a recipient public key whose private key is known only to some other party. That
party would then control the funds in the `ClaimableBalanceEntry` and could
claim them into any account that is authorized. A similar scheme could be
executed today by changing the signers on an account, but this would only be
possible once per authorized account and cannot separate out a fraction of the
funds. In summary, an approach that could allow `ClaimableBalanceEntry` to be
claimable into any account would significantly weaken the strength of
authorization restrictions.

### ClaimableBalanceEntry facilitates authorization
When issuing an authorization required asset to an account that does not exist,
there is a chicken-and-egg problem. The account does not exist and as such does
not have a trust line for the asset, so the issuer cannot authorize it. But the
issuer cannot send the funds without the existence of an authorized trust line.
This results in additional communication, either off-chain or on-chain. This
proposal seeks to simplify the situation. When a `ClaimableBalanceEntry` is
claimed, a trust line for the asset will be implicitly created if one does not
exist. If the `authorize` flag is also set, then the trust line will also be
authorized regardless of whether it was implicitly created.

Because the flag can only be set by the issuer and the `ClaimableBalanceEntry`
can only be claimed by accounts in `condition`, this allows the issuer to
effectively "pre-authorize". If there are multiple potential claimants and the
issuer does want to pre-authorize all of those accounts, they cannot use this
feature. But this is most useful for asset issuance, in which case there is
likely to be only one account. In any case, if the issuer is using this
functionality then they must be cognizant about clearing the `authorize` flag
for any `ClaimableBalanceEntry` claimable by an account from which they want to
revoke authorization.

### Should it be possible to increase the amount of a ClaimableBalanceEntry?
One issue which has been discussed during the development of this proposal is
the absence of a mechanism to increase the `amount` of a
`ClaimableBalanceEntry`. The specific scenario which would warrant this
functionality is when a single account sends many identical payments to a single
account that is not prepared to receive them and does not claim any of the
payments. However, this case is sufficiently specific that we recommend pursuing
it in a separate proposal once this proposal has been implemented. Delaying this
feature presents minimal additional difficulty because `ClaimableBalanceEntry`
has an extension point.

### Memo
Everything proposed in this document takes the same stance as existing features
of the protocol with regard to memo: memo is a property of a transaction, not of
an operation or a ledger entry.

### Example: Revocable Payment
An earlier draft of this proposal focused on revocable payments. A revocable
payment temporarily grants the option of permanent ownership to a specified
party. For example, a revocable payment of `100 X` from `A` to `B` on December
9th, 2019 might grant to `B` until December 16th, 2019 the option of permanent
ownership. Claiming permanent ownership costs only a transaction fee, so why
might `B` choose not to claim? One answer is that `B` may want to claim, but is
unable to because they have lost access to their account. Revocable payments
give senders the opportunity to retry a payment if the recipient is unable to
receive it.

We now consider the general case, in which the owner of account `A` wants to
send a revocable payment of `<AMOUNT>` of asset `X` to account `B` expiring at
time `T`. This can be done with the following `Operation`:
```
sourceAccount: A
body:
    type: CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE
    createClaimableBalanceOp:
        asset: X
        amount: <AMOUNT>
        condition[0]:
            destination: B
            weight: 1
            predicate:
                type: CLAIM_PREDICATE_BEFORE_ABSOLUTE_TIME
                absBefore: T
        condition[1]:
            destination: A
            weight: 1
            predicate:
                type: CLAIM_PREDICATE_AFTER_ABSOLUTE_TIME
                absAfter: T
        threshold: 1
```

## Backwards Incompatibilities
All downstream systems will need updated XDR in order to recognize the new
operations and ledger entries.

## Security Concerns
This proposal will slightly reduce the efficacy of base reserve changes, because
a `ClaimableBalanceEntry` that has insufficient reserve is still usable.

## Test Cases
None yet.

## Implementation
None yet.
