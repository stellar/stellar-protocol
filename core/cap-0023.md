CAP: 0023
Title:  Two-Part Payments with BalanceEntry
Author: Jonathan Jove
Status: Draft
Created: 2019-06-04
Discussion: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/303
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary
Payments can fail depending on the state of the destination account. This
proposal introduces new operations that separate sending a payment from
receiving the payment. Then the success of sending depends only on the state of
the sending account and success of receiving depends only on the state of the
receiving account.

## Motivation
This proposal seeks to solve the following problem: it should be easy to send a
payment to an account that is not necessarily prepared to receive the payment.
There are several manifestations of this problem, the two most important being

1. it should be easy for protocols (like an implementation of payment channels)
to pay out to participants, and
2. it should be easy for issuers to issue assets non-interactively.

### Goals Alignment
This proposal is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goal: The Stellar
Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via exchange of
assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments between assets
in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.

## Abstract
We introduce `BalanceEntry` as a new type of `LedgerEntry` which represents the
transfer of ownership of some amount of an asset. `CreateBalance` and
`ClaimBalance` operation enable the temporal separation of initiating and
receiving a payment, respectively. This will facilitate protocols built on the
Stellar network by providing a mechanism for payments that never fail. Existing
proposals, such as those for deterministic accounts, can provide a similar
mechanism but are not able to handle authorization restricted assets as easily.
A specific and simple protocol that will be facilitated is the asset issuance
protocol that creates an account for another party and issues an asset to that
account.

## Specification

### XDR

We first introduce `BalanceEntry` and the corresponding changes for
`LedgerEntryType` and `LedgerEntry`.
```c++
enum LedgerEntryType
{
    // ... ACCOUNT, TRUSTLINE, OFFER, unchanged ...
    DATA = 3,
    BALANCE = 4
};

struct BalanceEntry
{
    // If this BalanceEntry was created by operation index I in a transaction
    // with sourceAccount S and seqNum N, then balanceID = SHA256(S, N, I)
    Hash balanceID;

    // Can only be revoked by createdBy
    AccountID createdBy;

    // Can only be claimed by claimableBy
    AccountID claimableBy;

    // Amount of native asset to pay the reserve as of the ledger when this
    // BalanceEntry was created
    int64 reserve;

    // Any asset including native
    Asset asset;

    // Amount of asset
    int64 amount;

    // If authorize is true, authorize claimableBy for asset when this
    // BalanceEntry is claimed
    bool authorize;

    // Cannot be revoked (eg. claimed by createdBy) until after revokeTime
    Timepoint* revokeTime;
};

struct LedgerEntry
{
    uint32 lastModifiedLedgerSeq; // ledger the LedgerEntry was last changed

    union switch (LedgerEntryType type)
    {
    // ... ACCOUNT, TRUSTLINE, OFFER, DATA unchanged ...
    case BALANCE:
        BalanceEntry balance;
    }
    data;

    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};
```

We next introduce the new operations `CreateBalance`, `ClaimBalance`, and
`AuthorizeBalance` and the corresponding changes to `OperationType` and
`Operation`.
```c++
enum OperationType
{
    // ... CREATE_ACCOUNT, ..., BUMP_SEQUENCE unchanged ...
    MANAGE_BUY_OFFER = 12,
    CREATE_BALANCE = 13,
    CLAIM_BALANCE = 14,
    AUTHORIZE_BALANCE = 15
};

struct CreateBalance
{
    AccountID claimableBy;
    Asset asset;
    int64 amount;
    Timepoint* revokeTime;
};

struct ClaimBalance
{
    Hash balanceID;
};

struct AuthorizeBalance
{
    Hash balanceID;
    bool authorize;
};

struct Operation
{
    // sourceAccount is the account used to run the operation
    // if not set, the runtime defaults to "sourceAccount" specified at
    // the transaction level
    AccountID* sourceAccount;

    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACOUNT, ..., BUMP_SEQUENCE unchanged ...
    case CREATE_BALANCE:
        CreateBalance createBalanceOp;
    case CLAIM_BALANCE:
        ClaimBalance claimBalanceOp;
    case AUTHORIZE_BALANCE:
        AuthorizeBalance authorizeBalanceOp;
    }
    body;
};
```

We now introduce the result types `CreateBalanceResult`, `ClaimBalanceResult`,
and `AuthorizeBalanceResult` and the corresponding changes to `OperationResult`.
```c++
enum CreateBalanceResultCode
{
    CREATE_BALANCE_SUCCESS = 0,
    CREATE_BALANCE_MALFORMED = -1,
    CREATE_BALANCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED = -2,
    CREATE_BALANCE_LOW_RESERVE = -3,
    CREATE_BALANCE_UNDERFUNDED = -4
};

union CreateBalanceResult switch (CreateBalanceResultCode code)
{
case CREATE_BALANCE_SUCCESS:
    void;
default:
    void;
};

enum ClaimBalanceResultCode
{
    CLAIM_BALANCE_SUCCESS = 0,
    CLAIM_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST = -1,
    CLAIM_BALANCE_CANNOT_CLAIM = -2
    CLAIM_BALANCE_LOW_RESERVE = -3,
    CLAIM_BALANCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED = -4,
    CLAIM_BALANCE_LINE_FULL = -5,
};

union ClaimBalanceResult switch (ClaimBalanceResultCode code)
{
case CLAIM_BALANCE_SUCCESS:
    void;
default:
    void;
};

enum AuthorizeBalanceResultCode
{
    AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_SUCCESS = 0,
    AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST = -1,
    AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_NOT_ISSUER = -2,
    AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_TRUST_NOT_REQUIRED = -3,
    AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_CANT_REVOKE = -4
};

union AuthorizeBalanceResult switch (AuthorizeBalanceResultCode code)
{
case AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_SUCCESS:
    void;
default:
    void;
};

union OperationResult switch (OperationResultCode code)
{
case opINNER:
    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    // ... CREATE_ACOUNT, ..., BUMP_SEQUENCE unchanged ...
    case CREATE_BALANCE_ENTRY:
        CreateBalanceResult createBalanceResult;
    case CLAIM_BALANCE_ENTRY:
        ClaimBalanceResult claimBalanceResult;
    case AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_ENTRY:
        AuthorizeBalanceResult authorizeBalanceResult;
    }
    tr;
default:
    void;
};
```

### Semantics

### CreateBalance
A `BalanceEntry` can only be created by the `CreateBalance` operation. The
`balanceID` is generated from the SHA256 hash of the concatenation of the
source account of the transaction in which the `BalanceEntry` was created, the
sequence number of the source account, and the index of the `CreateBalance`
operation that created the `BalanceEntry`. This tuple ensures, up to hash
collision, that the `balanceID` is unique. The `createdBy` is set to the source
account of the `CreateBalance` operation that created the `BalanceEntry`. The
`reserve` equals the `baseReserve` at the time that the `BalanceEntry` is
created. Every `BalanceEntry` is created with `authorize = FALSE`, and the
`authorize` field is the only mutable part of a `BalanceEntry`. All other
fields are as specified in the `CreateBalance` operation.

`CreateBalance` returns

- `CREATE_BALANCE_MALFORMED` if the asset is invalid or the amount is non-positive
- `CREATE_BALANCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED` if the asset is `AUTH_REQUIRED` and the source
account does not have an authorized trust line
- `CREATE_BALANCE_LOW_RESERVE` if the source account has insufficient native asset
available (accounting for reserve and liabilities) to send `baseReserve`
- `CREATE_BALANCE_UNDERFUNDED` if the source account has insufficient `asset`
available (accounting for liabilities) to send `amount`
- `CREATE_BALANCE_SUCCESS` otherwise

### ClaimBalance
A `BalanceEntry` can only be deleted by the `ClaimBalance` operation. The source
account of the `ClaimBalance` operation must match `claimableBy` if `closeTime`
is before `revokeTime`, or must match `createdBy` otherwise. If the `BalanceEntry`
is claimed by `claimableBy` and `claimableBy` does not have a trust line for the
`asset`, then `ClaimBalance` will create one with `limit` equal to `amount`. If
the `BalanceEntry` is claimed by `claimableBy` and `authorize = TRUE`, then
`ClaimBalance` will authorize the trust line (regardless of whether it was just
created).

`ClaimBalance` returns

- `CLAIM_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` if there is no `BalanceEntry` matching `balanceID`
- `CLAIM_BALANCE_CANNOT_CLAIM` if the source account does not match the the relevant
of `createdBy` or `claimableBy`, depending on the `closeTime` and `revokeTime`
- `CLAIM_BALANCE_LOW_RESERVE` if the source account does not have a trust line for
`asset`, and it does not have sufficient balance (accounting for reserve and
liabilities) to create a trust line even after receiving the `reserve` from the
`BalanceEntry`
- `CLAIM_BALANCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED` if the source account does not have an authorized
trust line (checked after `ClaimBalance` potentially authorizes the trust line)
- `CLAIM_BALANCE_LINE_FULL` if the source account does not have sufficient available
balance of native asset (accounting for liabilities) to receive `reserve`, or does
not have sufficient available balance of `asset` (accounting for liabilities) to
receive `amount`
- `CLAIM_BALANCE_SUCCESS` otherwise

### AuthorizeBalance
The only part of a `BalanceEntry` that is mutable is the `authorize` flag, which
can be changed by the issuer of `asset` using `AuthorizeBalance`.

`AuthorizeBalance` returns

- `AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` if there is no `BalanceEntry` matching
`balanceID`
- `AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_NOT_ISSUER` if the source account is not the issuer of `asset`
- `AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_TRUST_NOT_REQUIRED` the `asset` is not `AUTH_REQUIRED`
- `AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_CANT_REVOKE` the asset is `AUTH_IMMUTABLE`
- `AUTHORIZE_BALANCE_SUCCESS` otherwise

## Design Rationale

### BalanceEntry is not a sub-entry
Each `BalanceEntry` exists as an independent entity on the ledger. It is clear
that the `BalanceEntry` cannot be a sub-entry of `claimableBy` because it is a
security risk for accounts to be able to add sub-entries to other accounts. But
why should the `BalanceEntry` be an independent entity on the ledger rather than
a sub-entry of `createdBy`? There are three main benefits of this design:

1. Sending accounts are not limited in the number of payments they can initiate
2. Sending accounts can be merged even if they initiated payments that have not
been claimed
3. Receiving accounts always receive the reserve from the claimed `BalanceEntry`

The third benefit facilitates a desirable optimization in which a `BalanceEntry`
can be directly converted into a `TrustLine`. This is useful in some asset
issuance workflows where the issuer wants to pay for the trustline but does not
want the recipient to spend the funds prior to creating the trustline. Of course
if the base reserve were raised after the `BalanceEntry` was created then the
reserve received would not be sufficient to pay for the trustline, but they would
at least still receive the reserve. But if the `BalanceEntry` were a sub-entry
of the sending account and the base reserve were raised such that the sending
account no longer satisfies the reserve requirement then the receiving account
would receive no reserve (because accounts that do not satisfy the reserve
requirement cannot have their native balance decrease). While this is an unlikely
edge case, it does simplify the behavior of `BalanceEntry` by guaranteeing that
the receiving account always receives both the reserve and the amount of asset.

### BalanceEntry createdBy and claimableBy are accountIDs
Each `BalanceEntry` can only be claimed by `claimableBy` or `createdBy` (exactly
one of them depending on the ledger close time). As a consequence, it is possible
for a `BalanceEntry` to become stranded. If `claimableBy` is merged and the
private key is not known, then the `BalanceEntry` will never be claimable by the
intended recipient. Similarly if `createdBy` is merged and the private key is not
known, then the `BalanceEntry` will never be reclaimable by the sender.

Suppose that we try to relax this requirement in order to avoid this downside. We
could instead attach two public keys to the `BalanceEntry`, where the sender alone
knows one of the private keys and the recipient alone knows the other. Which key is
currently usable would be determined by the ledger close time. The operation to
claim the `BalanceEntry` could then specify an account A and a signature over A
from the key that is currently usable. This would allow the appropriate party to
claim the `BalanceEntry` into any account that they control. But this would also
make it considerably easier to circumvent authorization restrictions on assets.
For instance, an authorized account could create a `BalanceEntry` with a recipient
public key whose private key is known only to some other party. That party would
then control the funds in the `BalanceEntry` and could claim them into any account
that is authorized. A similar scheme could be executed today by changing the
signers on an account, but this would only be possible once per authorized account
and cannot separate out a fraction of the funds. In summary, an approach that
could allow `BalanceEntry` to be claimable into any account would significantly
weaken the strength of authorization restrictions.

### BalanceEntry facilitates authorization
When issuing an authorization required asset to an account that does not exist,
there is a chicken-and-egg problem. The account does not exist and as such does
not have a trustline for the asset, so the issuer cannot authorize it. But the
issuer cannot send the funds without the existence of an authorized trustline.
This results in additional communication, either off-chain or on-chain. This
proposal seeks to simplify the situation. When a `BalanceEntry` is claimed by
`claimableBy`, a trustline for the asset will be implicitly created if one does
not exist. If the `authorize` flag is also set, then the trustline will also be
authorized regardless of whether it was implicitly created. Because the flag
can only be set by the issuer and the `BalanceEntry` can only be claimed by
`claimableBy`, this allows the issuer to effectively "pre-authorize". But if
the issuer is using this functionality, then the issuer must be cognizant about
clearing the `authorize` flag for any `BalanceEntry` paid to account A if they
revoke authorization from A.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
All downstream systems will need updated XDR in order to recognize the new
operations and ledger entries.

## Security Concerns
This proposal will slightly reduce the effectiveness of base reserve changes,
because a `BalanceEntry` that has insufficient reserve is still usable.
