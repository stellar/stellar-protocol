CAP: 0010
Title: Fee Bump Account
Author: Jeremy Rubin
Status: Draft
Created: 2018-11-13
Discussion: None
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary

Transactions get stuck because of insufficient fee sometimes, especially if the
protocol changes! 

We partially address this with fee-bumping account.

## Abstract

Transactions get stuck either because of insufficient fees being paid or because
min fees increase.

CAP-10 specifies a 64 bit fee-only account (denominated in basefees) which can
be used to bump subsequent transactions from the account.
## Motivation

In protocols which transactions are presigned or preauth for long durations,
it's a major headache if they can't get in because of fee insuficiency. CAP-05
helps with this issue a bit, but doesn't fully address the issue for when things
are truly stuck because they are now invalid.


## Specification


We extend the Account with a `fee_balance` account. `fee_balance` is a receive
only account.
```c++
struct AccountEntry
{
	// ... truncated
    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 1:
        struct
        {
            Liabilities liabilities;

            union switch (int v)
            {
            case 0:
                void;
			case 1:
				struct
				{
					int64 fee_balance;
					union switch (int v)
					{
						case 0:
							void;
					} ext;

				} v2;
            }
            ext;
        } v1;
    }
    ext;
};
```

Transactions should not be rejected for insufficient fee before querying to see
if a `fee_balance` exists and might cover the transaction.

When a transaction executes for a given source account, it bids a fee of `fee`.
In this case, the fee is first charged to the account and then any excess to the
`fee_balance`.
If the `fee` is insufficient for a given ledger, it then bids a fee of `fee +
fee_balance`. In this case, an amount `fee` paid is first charged against the
account, and then any excess is charged against the `fee_balance`.

On merge, the fees are forwarded to the `fee_balance` of the merge target.

We also introduce a new operation to add funds to a `fee_balance` account.

```c++
enum OperationType
{
    CREATE_ACCOUNT = 0,
    PAYMENT = 1,
    PATH_PAYMENT = 2,
    MANAGE_OFFER = 3,
    CREATE_PASSIVE_OFFER = 4,
    SET_OPTIONS = 5,
    CHANGE_TRUST = 6,
    ALLOW_TRUST = 7,
    ACCOUNT_MERGE = 8,
    INFLATION = 9,
    MANAGE_DATA = 10,
    BUMP_SEQUENCE = 11,
	BUMP_FEE = 12
};

struct BumpFeeOp
{
    AccountID recipient;
    SequenceNumber unless_passed;
    int64 amount;
};


enum BumpFeeResultCode
{
    // codes considered as "success" for the operation
    BUMP_FEE_SUCCESS = 0,
	BUMP_FEE_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE = 1,
};

union BumpSequenceResult switch (BumpSequenceResultCode code)
{
case BUMP_FEE_SUCCESS:
    void;
default:
    void;
};


union OperationResult switch (OperationResultCode code)
{
case opINNER:
    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    case CREATE_ACCOUNT:
        CreateAccountResult createAccountResult;
    case PAYMENT:
        PaymentResult paymentResult;
    case PATH_PAYMENT:
        PathPaymentResult pathPaymentResult;
    case MANAGE_OFFER:
        ManageOfferResult manageOfferResult;
    case CREATE_PASSIVE_OFFER:
        ManageOfferResult createPassiveOfferResult;
    case SET_OPTIONS:
        SetOptionsResult setOptionsResult;
    case CHANGE_TRUST:
        ChangeTrustResult changeTrustResult;
    case ALLOW_TRUST:
        AllowTrustResult allowTrustResult;
    case ACCOUNT_MERGE:
        AccountMergeResult accountMergeResult;
    case INFLATION:
        InflationResult inflationResult;
    case MANAGE_DATA:
        ManageDataResult manageDataResult;
    case BUMP_SEQUENCE:
        BumpSequenceResult bumpSeqResult;
    case BUMP_FEE:
        BumpFeeResult bumpFeeResult;
    }
    tr;
default:
    void;
};

```

The semantics of which are as follows:

If the account does not exist, nothing happens.

If the account sequence number is greater than `unless_passed`, nothing happens.

Otherwise, `min(op.amount, op.source.balance - op.source.reserved)` is deducted
from the source account and added to the destination's `fee_balance`.



## Rationale

It's not too expensive to add new entries to accounts, so we add a full 64 bits.
Alternatively, we could store a separate table for accounts with a
`fee_balance` as a subentry, but this is an implementer's choice.


We don't allow to recover the funds from the `fee_balance`, but we do allow them
to transfer during merge. This is a sort of "fee monad", which prevents
malapropriation of fee subsidies paid by third parties.

We asess fees against the account's balance first because the `fee_balance`
should only be touched in cases where the balance was insufficient to cover the
expressed transaction fee, or the expressed transaction fee was insufficient for
inclusion.

## Backwards Compatibility


Transactions which don't pay base fee rate must now query to see if a fee_balance
exists rather than being outright invalid.

Previously, a user might expect that transactions signed with 0 fee would not be
valid. Under this proposal, they may be. This doesn't really change the status
quo because users are not given a guarantee about transaction fees never
decreasing.

## Implementation

None yet.
