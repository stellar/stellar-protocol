## Simple Summary
This proposal makes it possible to pay reserves for another account.

## Motivation
This proposal seeks to solve the following problem: an entity should be able to
provide the reserve for accounts controlled by other parties without giving
those parties control of the reserve.

Consider, for example, an issuer that is willing to pay the reserve for trust
lines to the asset it issues. With the current version of the protocol, the
reserve must be part of the balance of an account. This means the issuer can
only pay the reserve by sending native asset to accounts that create a trust
line to the asset it issues. But this leaves the issuer vulnerable to attack
because an attacker can extract funds from the issuer by creating new accounts,
creating the trust line, waiting for the native asset to arrive, then removing
the trust line and merging the account.

This proposal is in many ways analogous to CAP-0015:

- CAP-0015 makes it possible to pay transaction fees for other accounts without
giving control of the underlying funds
- CAP-0031 makes it possible to pay reserves for other accounts without giving
control of the underlying funds

The combination of these two proposals should greatly facilitate the development
of non-custodial uses of the Stellar Network.

### Goals Alignment
This proposal is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goal:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products.

## Abstract
We introduce `SponsorshipEntry` as a new type of `LedgerEntry` which represents
an offer to pay the reserve for a `LedgerEntry` described by `descriptor`. The
operation `CreateSponsorshipOp` makes it possible to create a `SponsorshipEntry`
whereas the operation `RemoveSponsorshipOp` makes it possible to remove a
`SponsorshipEntry`. These operations are the only ways in which a
`SponsorshipEntry` can be created or removed, and they are otherwise immutable.

### Semantics

#### Available Balance and Limit of Native Asset
This proposal changes the definition of available balance of native asset to:
`balance - (2 + numSubEntries - sponsoredReserves) * baseReserve`. The
definition of available limit of native asset is unchanged, and remains
`INT64_MAX - balance`.

#### CreateSponsorshipOp
A `SponsorshipEntry` can only be created by the `CreateSponsorshipOp` operation.
`CreateSponsorshipOp` is invalid with `CREATE_SPONSORSHIP_MALFORMED` if

- `descriptor.type() == TRUSTLINE` and any of
    - `descriptor.trustLine().asset` is of type `ASSET_TYPE_NATIVE`
    - `descriptor.trustLine().asset` is invalid
- `descriptor.type() == OFFERS` and any of
    - `descriptor.offers().buying` is invalid
    - `descriptor.offers().selling` is invalid
    - `descriptor.offers().buying == descriptor.offers().selling`
- `descriptor.type() == DATA` and
    - `descriptor.data().dataName` is empty or invalid

The behavior of `CreateSponsorshipOp` is as follows:

1. Calculate `Multiplier` as
    - 3 if `descriptor.type() == ACCOUNT`
    - 2 otherwise
2. Fail with `CREATE_SPONSORSHIP_LOW_RESERVE` if the `sourceAccount` does not
   have at least `Multiplier * baseReserve` available balance of native asset
3. Deduct `Multiplier * baseReserve` of native asset from `sourceAccount`
4. Create a `SponsorshipEntry` as `sponsorship` with the following properties:
    - `sponsorship.createdBy = sourceAccount`
    - `sponsorship.sponsorshipID` as the next available
    - `sponsorship.descriptor = descriptor`
    - `sponsorship.reserve = Multiplier * baseReserve`
5. Count the number of existing `LedgerEntry` described by `descriptor` as
   `Sponsorable`
6. Count the number of existing `SponsorshipEntry` with
   `descriptor = sponsorship.descriptor` and
   `sponsorshipID < sponsorship.sponsorshipID` as `Sponsors`
7. Succeed with `CREATE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS` if `Sponsors >= Sponsorable`
8. Let `SponsoredAccount` be
    - `descriptor.account().accountID` if `descriptor.type() == ACCOUNT`
    - `descriptor.signer().accountID` if `descriptor.type() == SIGNER`
    - `descriptor.trustLine().accountID` if `descriptor.type() == TRUSTLINE`
    - `descriptor.offer().sellerID` if `descriptor.type() == OFFER`
    - `descriptor.data().accountID` if `descriptor.type() == DATA`
9. Succeed with `CREATE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS` if `SponsoredAccount` does not
   exist
10. Load `SponsoredAccount` and increment `SponsoredAccount.sponsoredReserves`
    by `Multiplier - 1`
11. Succeed with `CREATE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS`

`CreateSponsorshipOp` requires medium threshold because it can be used to send
funds.

#### RemoveSponsorshipOp
A `SponsorshipEntry` can only be removed by the `RemoveSponsorshipOp` operation.
`RemoveSponsorshipOp` is invalid with `REMOVE_SPONSORSHIP_MALFORMED` if

- `sponsorshipID <= 0`

The behavior of `RemoveSponsorshipOp` is as follows:

1. Fail with `REMOVE_SPONSORSHIP_DOES_NOT_EXIST` if there is no
   `SponsorshipEntry` with the specified `sponsorshipID`
2. Load the `SponsorshipEntry` as `sponsorship`
3. Fail with `REMOVE_SPONSORSHIP_NOT_CREATOR` if
   `sponsorship.createdBy != sourceAccount`
3. Count the number of existing `LedgerEntry` described by `descriptor` as
   `Sponsorable`
4. Count the number of existing `SponsorshipEntry` with
   `descriptor = sponsorship.descriptor` and
   `sponsorshipID < sponsorship.sponsorshipID` as `Sponsors`
5. Fail with `REMOVE_SPONSORSHIP_IN_USE` if `Sponsorable > Sponsors`
6. Fail with `REMOVE_SPONSORSHIP_LINE_FULL` if the `sourceAccount` does not have
   `reserve` available limit of native asset
7. Add `reserve` of native asset to `sourceAccount`
8. Remove `sponsorship`
9. Succeed with `REMOVE_SPONSORSHIP_SUCCESS`

`RemoveSponsorshipOp` requires medium threshold because it is related to
`CreateSponsorshipOp`.

3. Decrement `sourceAccount.numSubEntries`
4. ...

       `descriptor.offer().sellerID = trustor`,
       `descriptor.offer().buying = Buying`, and
       `descriptor.offer().selling = Selling` as `Sponsors`

## Design Rationale

### How are sponsorship entries paired with the ledger entries they sponsor?
Sponsorship entries are paired with the ledger entries they sponsor implicitly.
Sponsorship entries do not record what ledger entry they are currently
sponsoring, nor do ledger entries record what sponsorship entry is currently
sponsoring them. This is a consequence of the fact that there is no natural
pairing between individual entries. To understand this, consider the situation
where an account has two signers and there is a single sponsorship entry to
sponsor those signers. Obviously, only one of the signers can be sponsored at
any given time. But does it matter which one is sponsored? The answer is no:

- Regardless of which signer is sponsored, the sponsorship will contribute one
  sponsored reserve
- Regardless of which signer is sponsored, if either signer is removed then the
  remaining signer will be sponsored

Clearly, it is not meaningful to assign a sponsorship entry to a ledger entry.
But what if you want to know which sponsorship entries are actually sponsoring
a ledger entry? The answer to this question does matter, because it is
forbidden to delete a sponsorship entry that is providing reserves. The
sponsorship entries have an identifying characteristic, the `sponsorshipID`,
which makes it possible to unambiguously answer this question. If there are `N`
ledger entries that can be sponsored by a group of sponsorship entries with the
same `descriptor`, then the sponsorship entries among that group that are
actually sponsoring a ledger entry have the `N` lowest `sponsorshipID`. Because
`sponsorshipID` is monotonically increasing in the number of `SponsorshipEntry`
created, this is equivalent to the `N` oldest sponsorship entries that still
exist.

### Why do sponsorship entries sponsor reserve for only a single ledger entry?
It is reasonable to think that a single sponsorship entry might be able to
sponsor reserves for multiple ledger entries, such as a single sponsorship
entry sponsoring up to 5 signers. In fact, the earliest drafts of this proposal
had that feature. The feature was removed because the costs outweighed the
benefits. It considerably increased the complexity of certain aspects of this
proposal.

First, it is clear that not every type of sponsorship entry actually could
sponsor reserves for multiple ledger entries. Consider, for example, a
sponsorship entry for trust lines. There can only exist at most one trust line
that actually matches the `descriptor`, so there is no situation in which this
sponsorship entry can actually sponsor reserves for multiple ledger entries.
This led conceptually to two categories of sponsorship entries, which increased
the complexity of both the mental model and the implementation.

Second, it led to the introduction of a `ManageSponsorshipOp` operation
that was able to modify the number of reserves that a given sponsorship entry
could sponsor. This was required because it is not permitted to delete a
sponsorship entry that is providing reserves, so without the operation a
sponsorship entry that was configured to provide 10 reserves but was actually
only providing 1 could not be modified to release the other 9 reserves. The
semantics of this operation were quite complex, since it contained aspects of
both `CreateSponsorshipOp` and `RemoveSponsorshipOp`.

### Sponsorship entries always provide a full reserve
Suppose there exists an entity that creates accounts and trust lines for its
clients, using sponsorship entry to retain control of the reserve. At some point
in the future, the base reserve is increased. If the sponsorship entry provided
an actual amount of reserve based on the base reserve when it was created,
rather than a full reserve unconditionally, then the entity would now need to
increase the sponsorship for every client. For a large entity, this could be
many thousands of sponsorships to manage which would take time. In the interim,
their service would be degraded and the user experience for their clients
greatly harmed. The solution in this proposal avoids this issue entirely.

### Accounts record the total number of sponsored reserves
Theoretically, it is not necessary for accounts to record the total number of
sponsored reserves. The data is purely derived and can always be calculated at
any time. That being said, calculating it on demand is not particularly easy
because it requires iterating over all of the sub-entries of the account.
It is therefore likely that any performant implementation would store this data
either persistently or in a large-scale cache. But if the data is going to be
stored anyway, then it might as well be recorded in the ledger where it can be
utilized by downstream systems. Exactly the same arguments apply, for example,
to liabilities and `numSubEntries`.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
All downstream systems will need updated XDR in order to recognize the new
operations and ledger entries.

Downstream systems which calculate the required reserve for an account will now
potentially calculate a value that is too high. While inconvenient, this should
not cause any systems to fail.
