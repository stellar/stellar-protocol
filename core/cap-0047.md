```

## Simple Summary
This proposal defines the structure of smart contracts on Stellar, and specifies
how users can create, update, and remove them.

## Motivation
The motivation is the same as it is in
https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#motivation
- "The Stellar Network currently supports a rich but fixed repertoire of
transactions. Developers have indicated this repertoire is insufficiently
flexible in adapting to new application needs, and wish to be able to submit
custom turing-complete code to run in the transaction-execution phase of the
network."

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products

## Abstract
Users need a way to manage smart contracts on the network. This CAP allows users
to upload WASM code into a LedgerEntry. The host functions in
[CAP-0053](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0053.md#host-function-additions)
allow for contract updates and deletion. This CAP also lets the validators turn
off all smart contract functionality if some unexpected behavior is found in the
protocol.

## Semantics

### CreateContractTransaction
`CreateContractTransaction` will create a new `ContractDataEntry`
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0053.md) with
a `SCV_STATIC` key type, and `SCS_LEDGER_KEY_CONTRACT_CODE_WASM` key value. The
contractID will be the SHA-256 hash of a `HashIDPreimage`, with type
`ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID`, which contains the source account that created the
contract, and a salt provided by the user. The transaction will fail if a
contract with the calculated contractID already exists.

TODO: Reserve requirement for `ContractDataEntry`?

### Host function to create contracts
Factory contracts are quite popular already on other networks, so this CAP adds
functionality to support them. The contractID for these contracts will be
generated a little differently than a contract created by an account. The
`add_contract` call will create the new contractID by taking the SHA-256 hash of
a `HashIDPreimage`, with type `ENVELOPE_TYPE_CHILD_CONTRACT_ID`, which contains
the parent contractID, and a salt that the parent contract passes to
`create_contract`.

```rust
// creates a new contract
fn create_contract(contract: Vec<u8>, salt: Vec<u8>) -> /*Returns new contractID if contract was created. Empty result otherwise*/;
```

TODO: How does this work with the new fee model?

### Configuration settings using Ledger Upgrades
This CAP also adds a mechanism for validators to store and update configuration
options using ledger upgrades. The maximum WASM contract size will be set during
the protocol upgrade using a new `ConfigurationEntry`, with `ConfigSettingID` ==
`CONFIG_TYPE_CONTRACT_MAX_SIZE`, and `ConfigSetting.uint32Val` == `16384`. This
new entry can be updated using a `LedgerUpgrade`. This mechanism is generalized
to allow validators to update any configuration settings we add. Note that
validators cannot add or remove configuration settings using `LedgerUpgrades`.
New configurations need to be added during the protocol upgrade.

### Validator override
This proposal adds two new `LedgerHeader` flags that can disable the create and
invoke contract operations using upgrades. The validators can use this mechanism
in case unexpected behaviour is seen. We also considered adding a mechanism for
validators to opt accounts into smart contracts to allow for a "soft" launch,
but the implementation changes to get this to work are not simple. The
validators have the `LedgerHeader` overrides to fall back on, so it's not clear
that the complexity of adding a "soft" launch mechanism is worth it.

## Design Rationale

### There are no built in controls for contracts
Controls like pausing invocation or mutability for all or a subset of a contract
should be put into a contract itself. Leaving it to the contract writer is a much
more general solution than baking it into the protocol. The downside is this is
more error prone and will take more space since the same logic will be
implemented multiple times.

### ContractDataEntry has no account associated with it
The account that creates the `ContractDataEntry` that contains the contract code
is not tied to it in any way. This allows for contract management and
authorization to be handled in the contract using whichever custom mechanism the
contract creator chooses.

### Contracts can be updated and deleted
The contract code is stored in a `ContractDataEntry`, so contracts can update or
delete that entry. If the contract code is updated or deleted, the host function
should terminate contract invocation to prevent the contract from doing
something potentialy dangerous like writing new data after deleting a contract.

TODO: Contract ID's don't have a seqnum or a nonce, so they can be recreated.
This could be an issue if the deleted contract still has data on the ledger.

### Malicious contracts
The validators do not have a mechanism to ban specific contracts. Any kind of
targeted banning mechanism can be worked around quite easily by creating new
accounts and contracts.

### WASM contract code size is configurable
The maximum contract size will be set during the protocol upgrade, and can be
updated by the validators. This makes it easier to increase the maximum contract
size without updating the XDR. Note that we will still have a hardcoded upper
bound set in the XDR. This mechanism can also be used to reduce the contract
size if the validators ever see a need to (TODO: size reduction is still up for
debate).

### ContractID is calculated differently when created in another contract vs a classic Stellar transaction.
Pulling contractIDs from `LedgerHeader.idPool` would be easier but it would make
parallelizing contract creation more difficult in the future. It's also more
difficult to determine what the contractID will be since the id pool would be
used by offers and other contracts. This CAP uses a `Hash` instead as the
contractID. `CreateContractTransaction` uses the source account and a salt,
while contracts created within other contracts use the parent contractID and a
salt.

## Security Concerns
The security concerns from CAP-0046
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#security-concerns)
apply here as well. In addition to those concerns, this CAP does not provide
validators with much control over contracts on the network. The only mechanism
they have is blocking all contract creations and invocations, which should only
be used in drastic situations. This CAP does not define a way for validators to
block specific contracts.

## Extensions

### Contract metadata
A ContractMetadata union can accompany the WASM contract as another
`ContractDataEntry` with a new `SCV_STATIC` key type, which would specify the
functions available in the contract, along with the return and argument types
for each function. The host function to call into the WASM contract should first
validate the contract call against the metadata. If the contract call does not
match one of the functions specified in the metadata, then an error will be
thrown.

Users can also load the ContractMetadata to see what the interface looks like.

This metadata can be extended to include
versioning or the router logic mentioned at the end of this CAP.

TODO: The xdr currently puts an arbitrary limit (10) on the number of function
signatures and arguments in the metadata. This needs to be revisited.

```c++
enum ContractMetadataType
{
    METADATA_TYPE_V0 = 0
};

union SCType switch (SCValType type)
{
case SCV_U63:
case SCV_U32:
case SCV_I32:
case SCV_STATIC:
    void;
case SCV_OBJECT:
    SCObjectType objType;
case SCV_SYMBOL:
case SCV_BITSET:
case SCV_STATUS:
    void;
};

struct FunctionSignature
{
    SCSymbol function;
    SCType returnType;
    SCType argTypes<10>;
}

union ContractMetadata switch (ContractMetadataType type)
{
case METADATA_TYPE_V0:
    FunctionSignature interface<10>;
};

```
### Contract metadata can include a router along with the raw WASM
- This has a couple advantages - 
  - A contract function that just calls into another contract can specify that
    route in the router, allowing the initial contract to avoid spinning up a
    WASM VM.
    - Possible routes are - 
      - This contract
      - External contract
      - Host function
  - This will allow contracts to build off the functionality of other contracts
    without having to duplicate existing functionality, saving space on the
    ledger.

#### XDR

```c++
enum CallType
{
    SELF_CONTRACT = 0,
    EXTERNAL_CONTRACT = 1,
    HOST_FUNCTION = 2
};

struct FunctionSignature
{
    SCSymbol function;
    SCValType returnType;
    SCValType argTypes<10>;

    union switch (CallType v)
    {
    case EXTERNAL_CONTRACT:
        int64 contractID;
    case SELF_CONTRACT:
    case HOST_FUNCTION:
        void;
    } callType;
}
```
