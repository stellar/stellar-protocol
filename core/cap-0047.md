## Simple Summary
This proposal defines the structure of smart contracts on Stellar, and specifies
how users can create, update, and remove them.

## Motivation
The motivation is the same as it is in
https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#motivation
- "The Stellar Network currently supports a rich but fixed repertoire of
transactions. Developers have indicated this repertoire is insufficiently
flexible in adapting to new application needs, and wish to be able to submit
custom turing-complete code to run in the transaction-execution phase of the
network."

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products

## Abstract
Users need a way to manage smart contracts on the network. This CAP allows the
user to upload WASM code into a LedgerEntry, update the contract code, and lock
all updates to the contract code going forward if desired. This CAP also lets
the validators initially roll out smart contracts access to a subset of accounts
using an allow list, and also gives them the ability to turn off all smart
contract functionality if some unexpected behavior is found in the protocol.

## Specification

### XDR

```c++
typedef opaque WASMCode<16384>;

enum ContractCodeType {
    CONTRACT_CODE_WASM = 0
};

enum ContractMetadataType
{
    METADATA_TYPE_V0 = 0
};

union SCType switch (SCValType type)
{
case SCV_U63:
case SCV_U32:
case SCV_I32:
case SCV_STATIC:
    void;
case SCV_OBJECT:
    SCObjectType objType;
case SCV_SYMBOL:
case SCV_BITSET:
case SCV_STATUS:
    void;
};

struct FunctionSignature
{
    SCSymbol function;
    SCType returnType;
    SCTypes argTypes<10>;
}

union ContractMetadata switch (ContractMetadataType type)
{
case METADATA_TYPE_V0:
    FunctionSignature interface<10>;
};

union ContractBody switch (ContractCodeType type)
{
    case CONTRACT_CODE_WASM:
        WASMCode wasm;
};

enum ContractAuthFlags
{ 
    // Contract body and flags cannot be changed
    CONTRACT_IMMUTABLE = 0x1
};

/* Create a smart contract

   Threshold: med

   Result: CreateContractResult
*/
struct CreateContractOp
{
    ContractMetadata metadata;
    ContractBody body;
};

/* Update a smart contract

   Threshold: med

   Result: UpdateContractResult
*/
struct UpdateContractOp
{
    int64 contractID;
    uint32 *contractAuthFlags;
    ContractMetadata *metadata;
    ContractBody *body;
};

/* Remove a smart contract

   Threshold: med

   Result: RemoveContractResult
*/
struct RemoveContractOp
{
    int64 contractID;
};

enum LedgerHeaderFlags
{
    DISABLE_LIQUIDITY_POOL_TRADING_FLAG = 0x1,
    DISABLE_LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_FLAG = 0x2,
    DISABLE_LIQUIDITY_POOL_WITHDRAWAL_FLAG = 0x4,
    //New flags
    DISABLE_CONTRACT_CREATE = 0x8,
    DISABLE_CONTRACT_UPDATE = 0x10,
    DISABLE_CONTRACT_REMOVE = 0x20,
    DISABLE_CONTRACT_INVOKE = 0x40
};

struct ContractCodeEntry {
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;

    AccountID owner;
    int64 contractID;
    uint32 authFlags;
    
    ContractMetadata metadata;
    ContractBody body;
};

//TODO: Operation result codes
```

## Semantics

### Operations

#### CreateContractOp
`CreateContractOp` will create a new `ContractCodeEntry`, and assign it a unique
contractID. By default, the contract will be enabled without any flags set,
which means it is mutable.

The new `ContractCodeEntry` will be sponsored by the source account or the
sponsoring account if the source account is in a sponsorship sandwich, but it
will not be a subentry. This is similar to the relationship accounts have with
claimable balances.

#### UpdateContractOp
`UpdateContractOp` will modify an existing contract. All parameters except the
contractID are optional. contractAuthFlags will update the flags on the contract
if `CONTRACT_IMMUTABLE` is not set.

#### RemoveContractOp
`RemoveContractOp` will remove an empty contract if possible.
TODO: What if the
contract can own a LedgerEntry like a Trustline? What happens to data owned by
the contract? How would you delete the contract?

All three operations will fail if the source account is not the owner specified
on the contract.

### Validator override
This proposal adds two new `LedgerHeader` flags that can disable the create and
invoke contract operations using upgrades. (I don't think we should do this… but
it's in the proposal so we can discuss it).

## Design Rationale
The only contract control on the "Classic" side in mutability The contract owner
can mark a contract as mutable, but any other kind of controls like pausing
invocation for all or a subset of a contract should be put into a contract
itself. The pausing functionally can be part of `UpdateContractOp`, but it would
disable invocation for the entire contract, which may not be the desired
outcome. Leaving it to the contract owner is a much more general solution than
baking it into the protocol. The downside is this is more error prone and will
take more space since the same logic will be implemented multiple times. If we
think this is a feature most contract writers want, then we should consider
generalizing it.

### Contracts are mutable by default
Allowing mutable contracts will make upgrades simpler for contract creators. We
have seen how users of other smart contract platforms have deployed alternative
solutions like proxy contracts to imitate upgradeability, but these solutions
are more expensive and complex. Allowing mutable contracts will give users an
additional choice in how they would like to manage upgrades.  
Create/update/delete operations are used to manage a contract instead of a
single operation Keeping these operations separate makes the operation
parameters easier to understand for the user. `UpdateContractOp` is analogous to
`SetOptionsOp`, where the only fields that are updated are the ones that are not
null. This behavior would be confusing if we combined the create, update, and
delete operations. 

### Contract size
16384 was chosen because it should be big enough for most contracts, while not
taking too much space in the ledger and transaction sets. This is still very
much up for discussion. If we're worried about the transaction set size, we
could allow contract owners to upload their contracts in smaller chunks, and
then use an activation operation to enable them.

### Malicious contracts
The validators do not have a mechanism to ban specific contracts. Any kind of
targeted banning mechanism can be worked around quite easily by creating new
accounts and contracts.

### Contract Metadata
This CAP defines a ContractMetadata union to accompany the WASM contract. It
specifies the functions available in the contract, along with the return and
arguments types for each function. The host function to call into the WASM
contract should first validate the contract call against the metadata. If the
contract call does not match one of the functions specified in the metadata,
then an error will be thrown.

Users can also load the ContractMetadata to see what the interface looks like.

This metadata can be extended to include
versioning or the router logic mentioned at the end of this CAP.

### Versioning
TODO:

## Security Concerns
The security concerns from CAP-0046
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#security-concerns)
apply here as well. In addition to those concerns, this CAP does not provide
validators with much control over contracts on the network. The only mechanism
they have is blocking all contract creations and invocations, which should only
be used in drastic situations. This CAP does not define a way for validators to
block specific contracts.

## Possible optimizations

### Contracts include a router along with the raw WASM
- This has a couple advantages - 
  - A contract function that just calls into another contract can specify that
    route in the router, allowing the initial contract to avoid spinning up a
    WASM VM.
    - Possible routes are - 
      - This contract
      - External contract
      - Host function
  - This will allow contracts to build off the functionality of other contracts
    without having to duplicate existing functionality, saving space on the
    ledger.

#### XDR

```c++
enum CallType
{
    SELF_CONTRACT = 0,
    EXTERNAL_CONTRACT = 1,
    HOST_FUNCTION = 2
};

struct FunctionSignature
{
    SCSymbol function;
    SCValType returnType;
    SCValType argTypes<10>;

    union switch (CallType v)
    {
    case EXTERNAL_CONTRACT:
        int64 contractID;
    case SELF_CONTRACT:
    case HOST_FUNCTION:
        void;
    } callType;
}
```
