## Simple Summary
This proposal defines the structure of smart contracts on Stellar, and specifies
how users can create, update, and remove them.

## Motivation
The motivation is the same as it is in
https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#motivation
- "The Stellar Network currently supports a rich but fixed repertoire of
transactions. Developers have indicated this repertoire is insufficiently
flexible in adapting to new application needs, and wish to be able to submit
custom turing-complete code to run in the transaction-execution phase of the
network."

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products

## Abstract
Users need a way to manage smart contracts on the network. This CAP allows the
user to upload WASM code into a LedgerEntry, update the contract code, and lock
all updates to the contract code going forward if desired. This CAP also lets
the validators initially roll out smart contracts access to a subset of accounts
using an allow list, and also gives them the ability to turn off all smart
contract functionality if some unexpected behavior is found in the protocol.

## Semantics

### Operations

#### CreateContractOp
`CreateContractOp` will create a new `ContractCodeEntry`, and assign it a unique
contractID.

The new `ContractCodeEntry` will be sponsored by the source account or the
sponsoring account if the source account is in a sponsorship sandwich, but it
will not be a subentry. This is similar to the relationship accounts have with
claimable balances.

#### UpdateContractOp
`UpdateContractOp` will modify an existing contract. All parameters except the
contractID are optional.

#### RemoveContractOp
`RemoveContractOp` will remove an empty contract if possible.
TODO: What if the
contract can own a LedgerEntry like a Trustline? What happens to data owned by
the contract? How would you delete the contract?

All three operations will fail if the source account is not the owner specified
on the contract.

### Configuration settings using Ledger Upgrades
This CAP also adds a mechanism for validators to store and update configuration
options using ledger upgrades. The maximum WASM contract size will be set during
the protocol upgrade using a new `ConfigurationEntry`, with `ConfigSettingID` ==
`CONFIG_TYPE_CONTRACT_MAX_SIZE`, and `ConfigSetting.uint32Val` == `16384`. This
new entry can be updated using a `LedgerUpgrade`. This mechanism is generalized
to allow validators to update any configuration settings we add. Note that
validators cannot add or remove configuration settings using `LedgerUpgrades`.
New configurations need to be added during the protocol upgrade.

### Validator override
This proposal adds four new `LedgerHeader` flags that can disable the create,
update, remove, and invoke contract operations using upgrades. The validators
can use this mechanism in case unexpected behaviour is seen. We also considered
adding a mechanism for validators to opt accounts into smart contracts to allow
for a "soft" launch, but the implementation changes to get this to work are not
simple. The validators have the `LedgerHeader` overrides to fall back on, so
it's not clear that the complexity of adding a "soft" launch mechanism is worth
it.

## Design Rationale

### There are no built in controls for contracts
Controls like pausing invocation or mutability for all or a subset of a contract
should be put into a contract itself. The pausing functionally can be part of
`UpdateContractOp`, but it would disable invocation for the entire contract,
which may not be the desired outcome. Leaving it to the contract owner is a much
more general solution than baking it into the protocol. The downside is this is
more error prone and will take more space since the same logic will be
implemented multiple times. If we think this is a feature most contract writers
want, then we should consider generalizing it. Mutability can also be added on
to the manifest, but we have left it out for now since we don't think it will be
used much. We can base this off of what we've seen with few assets using
`AUTH_IMMUTABLE`.

### Contracts are mutable
Allowing mutable contracts will make upgrades simpler for contract creators. We
have seen how users of other smart contract platforms have deployed alternative
solutions like proxy contracts to imitate upgradeability, but these solutions
are more expensive and complex. Allowing mutable contracts will give users an
additional choice in how they would like to manage upgrades.  
Create/update/delete operations are used to manage a contract instead of a
single operation Keeping these operations separate makes the operation
parameters easier to understand for the user. `UpdateContractOp` is analogous to
`SetOptionsOp`, where the only fields that are updated are the ones that are not
null. This behavior would be confusing if we combined the create, update, and
delete operations. 

### Contract size
16384 was chosen because it should be big enough for most contracts, while not
taking too much space in the ledger and transaction sets. This is still very
much up for discussion. If we're worried about the transaction set size, we
could allow contract owners to upload their contracts in smaller chunks, and
then use an activation operation to enable them.

### Malicious contracts
The validators do not have a mechanism to ban specific contracts. Any kind of
targeted banning mechanism can be worked around quite easily by creating new
accounts and contracts.

### Contract Metadata
This CAP defines a ContractMetadata union to accompany the WASM contract. It
specifies the functions available in the contract, along with the return and
arguments types for each function. The host function to call into the WASM
contract should first validate the contract call against the metadata. If the
contract call does not match one of the functions specified in the metadata,
then an error will be thrown.

Users can also load the ContractMetadata to see what the interface looks like.

This metadata can be extended to include
versioning or the router logic mentioned at the end of this CAP.

### Versioning
TODO:

## Security Concerns
The security concerns from CAP-0046
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#security-concerns)
apply here as well. In addition to those concerns, this CAP does not provide
validators with much control over contracts on the network. The only mechanism
they have is blocking all contract creations and invocations, which should only
be used in drastic situations. This CAP does not define a way for validators to
block specific contracts.

## Possible optimizations

### Contracts include a router along with the raw WASM
- This has a couple advantages - 
  - A contract function that just calls into another contract can specify that
    route in the router, allowing the initial contract to avoid spinning up a
    WASM VM.
    - Possible routes are - 
      - This contract
      - External contract
      - Host function
  - This will allow contracts to build off the functionality of other contracts
    without having to duplicate existing functionality, saving space on the
    ledger.

#### XDR

```c++
enum CallType
{
    SELF_CONTRACT = 0,
    EXTERNAL_CONTRACT = 1,
    HOST_FUNCTION = 2
};

struct FunctionSignature
{
    SCSymbol function;
    SCValType returnType;
    SCValType argTypes<10>;

    union switch (CallType v)
    {
    case EXTERNAL_CONTRACT:
        int64 contractID;
    case SELF_CONTRACT:
    case HOST_FUNCTION:
        void;
    } callType;
}
```
