## Simple Summary
This proposal defines the structure of smart contracts on Stellar, and specifies
how users can create, update, and remove them.

## Motivation
The motivation is the same as it is in
https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#motivation
- "The Stellar Network currently supports a rich but fixed repertoire of
transactions. Developers have indicated this repertoire is insufficiently
flexible in adapting to new application needs, and wish to be able to submit
custom turing-complete code to run in the transaction-execution phase of the
network."

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products

## Abstract
Users need a way to manage smart contracts on the network. This CAP allows the
user to upload WASM code into a LedgerEntry, update the contract code, and lock
all updates to the contract code going forward if desired. This CAP also lets
the validators initially roll out smart contracts access to a subset of accounts
using an allow list, and also gives them the ability to turn off all smart
contract functionality if some unexpected behavior is found in the protocol.

## Specification

## Semantics

### CreateContractTransaction
`CreateContractTransaction` will create a new `ContractCodeEntry`, and assign it
a unique contractID. The contractID will be the SHA-256 hash of a
`HashIDPreimage`, with type `ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID`, which contains the
source account that created the contract, and the sequence number for that
source account consumed in that transaction. Note that this assumes only one
contract can be created per transaction.

TODO: Reserve requirement for `ContractCodeEntry`?

### Host function to remove contracts
We will provide a host function to allow for the removal of contracts.
`remove_contract` will remove the `ContractCodeEntry` that corresponds to the
contractID of the current executing contract. The call to `remove_contract` will
result in a positive termination condition. (TODO: Is this possible?)
```rust
fn remove_contract() -> bool;
```

TODO: What about contract data? The `SEQUENCE` ledger entry mentioned below?
What's the incentive for users to remove contracts (this depends on the fee
model)? This might not be worth it for the initial version if the incentives
don't make sense.

### Host function to create contracts
Factory contracts are quite popular already on other networks, so this CAP adds
functionality to support them. The contractID for these contracts will be
generated a little differently than a contract created by an account. First, the
contract must make sure that a `SEQUENCE` ledger entry exists for this
contractID by calling `create_seq`. After that, any `add_contract` call will
create the new contractID by taking the SHA-256 hash of a `HashIDPreimage`, with
type `ENVELOPE_TYPE_CHILD_CONTRACT_ID`, which contains the parent contractID,
and the sequence number from the `SEQUENCE` ledger entry. The sequence number in
the `SEQUENCE` ledger entry is then incremented.

```rust
// creates a SEQUENCE ledger entry, with seqNum set to 0
fn create_seq() -> bool;

// creates a new contract. Parent contract must have a SEQUENCE ledger entry. Will fail otherwise
fn add_contract(contract: Vec<u8>) -> bool;
```

TODO: Add the `SEQUENCE` ledger entry to the XDR.
TODO: How does this work with the new fee model?

### Configuration settings using Ledger Upgrades
This CAP also adds a mechanism for validators to store and update configuration
options using ledger upgrades. The maximum WASM contract size will be set during
the protocol upgrade using a new `ConfigurationEntry`, with `ConfigSettingID` ==
`CONFIG_TYPE_CONTRACT_MAX_SIZE`, and `ConfigSetting.uint32Val` == `16384`. This
new entry can be updated using a `LedgerUpgrade`. This mechanism is generalized
to allow validators to update any configuration settings we add. Note that
validators cannot add or remove configuration settings using `LedgerUpgrades`.
New configurations need to be added during the protocol upgrade.

### Validator override
This proposal adds four new `LedgerHeader` flags that can disable the create,
update, remove, and invoke contract operations using upgrades. The validators
can use this mechanism in case unexpected behaviour is seen. We also considered
adding a mechanism for validators to opt accounts into smart contracts to allow
for a "soft" launch, but the implementation changes to get this to work are not
simple. The validators have the `LedgerHeader` overrides to fall back on, so
it's not clear that the complexity of adding a "soft" launch mechanism is worth
it.

## Design Rationale

### There are no built in controls for contracts
Controls like pausing invocation or mutability for all or a subset of a contract
should be put into a contract itself. Leaving it to the contract writer is a much
more general solution than baking it into the protocol. The downside is this is
more error prone and will take more space since the same logic will be
implemented multiple times.

### ContractCodeEntry has no account associated with it
The account that creates the `ContractCodeEntry` is not associated with it in any
way. This means that any changes to the contract metadata must be done in the
contract through host functions. This isn't ideal, since some of these features
may not be available when the contracts are initally written. For example, we
are considering leaving the metadata out of the initial version, or even
introducing a fast routing scheme to the metadata mentioned at the bottom of
this CAP in the future. An alternative to this is to add an "admin" account to the
`ContractCodeEntry`, which can be used along with another transaction to update
the metadata.

### Contracts are immutable on launch
Contract writers can use proxy contracts to upgrade contract logic, so mutable
contract code is not neccessary. Keeping contracts immutable will keep the
protocol implementation simpler so we can get a working product out faster. We
can always add this functionality later. Note that contracts written before
contract mutability is introduced will always be immutable.

### Malicious contracts
The validators do not have a mechanism to ban specific contracts. Any kind of
targeted banning mechanism can be worked around quite easily by creating new
accounts and contracts.

### WASM contract code size is configurable
The maximum contract size will be set during the protocol upgrade, and can be
updated by the validators. This makes it easier to increase the maximum contract
size without updating the XDR. Note that we will still have a hardcoded upper
bound set in the XDR. This mechanism can also be used to reduce the contract
size if tha validators ever see a need to (TODO: size reduction is still up for
debate).

### ContractID is calculated differently when created in another contract vs a classic Stellar transaction.
Pulling contractIDs from `LedgerHeader.idPool` would be easier but it would make
parallelizing contract creation more difficult in the future. It's also more
difficult to determine what the contractID will be since the id pool would be
used by offers and other contracts. This CAP uses a `Hash` instead as the
contractID. `CreateContractTransaction` uses the source account and source
account sequence number, but this doesn't make sense when a contract creates
another contract because multiple contracts can be created in a single
invocation. In that case, we use the parent contractID and a new
`SEQUENCE` ledger entry created just for this scenario.

Note that this means a deleted contractID cannot be reused.

## Security Concerns
The security concerns from CAP-0046
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#security-concerns)
apply here as well. In addition to those concerns, this CAP does not provide
validators with much control over contracts on the network. The only mechanism
they have is blocking all contract creations and invocations, which should only
be used in drastic situations. This CAP does not define a way for validators to
block specific contracts.

## Extensions

### Mutable contracts
We can add host functions that allow contracts to rewrite their own
`ContractCodeEntry`, which will allow for more flexiblity like upgradable
contracts without proxies. If mutable contracts are introduced, the host
function to write the updated `ContractCodeEntry` should be the last thing to
happen in the contract. This would ideally be enforced with a positive
termination condition in WASM.

### Contract metadata
A ContractMetadata union can accompany the WASM contract, which would specify
the functions available in the contract, along with the return and argument
types for each function. The host function to call into the WASM contract should
first validate the contract call against the metadata. If the contract call does
not match one of the functions specified in the metadata, then an error will be
thrown.

Users can also load the ContractMetadata to see what the interface looks like.

This metadata can be extended to include
versioning or the router logic mentioned at the end of this CAP.

TODO: The xdr currently puts an arbitrary limit (10) on the number of function
signatures and arguments in the metadata. This needs to be revisited.

```c++
enum ContractMetadataType
{
    METADATA_TYPE_V0 = 0
};

union SCType switch (SCValType type)
{
case SCV_U63:
case SCV_U32:
case SCV_I32:
case SCV_STATIC:
    void;
case SCV_OBJECT:
    SCObjectType objType;
case SCV_SYMBOL:
case SCV_BITSET:
case SCV_STATUS:
    void;
};

struct FunctionSignature
{
    SCSymbol function;
    SCType returnType;
    SCType argTypes<10>;
}

union ContractMetadata switch (ContractMetadataType type)
{
case METADATA_TYPE_V0:
    FunctionSignature interface<10>;
};

//CreateContractTransaction and ContractCodeEntry should be extended to add on ContractMetadata 
```
### Contract metadata can include a router along with the raw WASM
- This has a couple advantages - 
  - A contract function that just calls into another contract can specify that
    route in the router, allowing the initial contract to avoid spinning up a
    WASM VM.
    - Possible routes are - 
      - This contract
      - External contract
      - Host function
  - This will allow contracts to build off the functionality of other contracts
    without having to duplicate existing functionality, saving space on the
    ledger.

#### XDR

```c++
enum CallType
{
    SELF_CONTRACT = 0,
    EXTERNAL_CONTRACT = 1,
    HOST_FUNCTION = 2
};

struct FunctionSignature
{
    SCSymbol function;
    SCValType returnType;
    SCValType argTypes<10>;

    union switch (CallType v)
    {
    case EXTERNAL_CONTRACT:
        int64 contractID;
    case SELF_CONTRACT:
    case HOST_FUNCTION:
        void;
    } callType;
}
```
