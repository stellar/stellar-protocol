Status: Draft

Discussion: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1553
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary

Emit `transfer`, `mint`, `burn`, `clawback`, and `fee` events in Classic in the same format as what we see in Soroban so that the movement of assets can be tracked using a single stream of data. In addition to emitting events in Classic, update the events emitted in the Stellar Asset Contract to be semantically correct and compatible with SEP-41.

## Motivation

Tracking the movement of Stellar assets today is complex because you need to consume both Soroban events emitted by the Stellar Asset Contract and ledger entry changes for Classic operations. There are also differences between Stellar assets and custom Soroban tokens that this CAP will address so those differences will be made irrelevant to the end user.

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

  - The Stellar Network should be secure and reliable, and should bias towards safety, simplicity,
  reliability, and performance over new functionality.

## Abstract

The changes specified by this CAP - 
* Remove the admin from the topics of the `mint` and `clawback` events emitted in the SAC.
* Update issuer semantics in the SAC so that a `transfer` involving the issuer will emit the semantically correct event (`mint` or `burn`).
* Add memo support to Soroban by adding a `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_MUXED_ACCOUNT` and allow the SAC to take in this type in the `transfer` function call.
* Update the `data` field in the `transfer` event from an integer to a map to store additional memo information.
* Prohibit the transaction memo from being set on Soroban transactions, as well as soroban transactions with `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS` and a muxed source account.
* Emit an event for every movement of an `Asset` of types `ASSET_TYPE_NATIVE`, `ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM4`, and `ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM12`. in Stellar classic. All of the added events will follow the format of the existing Stellar Asset Contract events, with the exception of a new `fee` event to track fees paid by the source account.

## Semantics

### Remove the admin from the SAC `mint` and `clawback` events

The `mint` event will look like:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

The `clawback` event will look like:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["clawback", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

### Emit the semantically correct event for a Stellar Asset Contract `transfer` when the issuer is involved 

At the moment, if the issuer is the sender in a Stellar Asset Contract `transfer`, the asset will be minted. If the issuer is the recipient, the asset will be burned. The event emitted in both scenarios, however, is the `transfer` event. This CAP changes that behavior to instead emit the `mint`/`burn` event.

### Multiplexing support

Multiplexing (muxing) is a technique used by the Stellar users to represent custodial accounts, i.e. accounts that are represented by a single on-chain entity, but may have an arbitrary number of off-chain, 'virtual' balances. Stellar protocol currently provides two ways for supporting the account 'multiplexing' ('muxing'): using the transaction memo to identify the payment destination, and the `MuxedAccount` type that can identify the source or destination of most of the Stellar operations.

This CAP ensures that muxing information is represented in the events, and also extends the multiplexing functionality to Soroban operations.

#### Update the SAC `transfer` function to take in a `MuxedAccount` for `from` and `to`

The `transfer` function of the Stellar Asset contract will be updated to accept the `MuxedAccounts` via `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_MUXED_ACCOUNT` addresses.

#### Prohibit the transaction memo and muxed source accounts from being set on Soroban transactions
In order to avoid confusion between the multiplexing support mechanism via `transfer` contract function, and the existing multiplexing mechanisms the following changes are made:

- Any transaction with an `InvokeHostFunctionOp` operation that has `memo` set to a value other than `MEMO_NONE` will be rejected as invalid.
- Any transaction with an `InvokeHostFunctionOp` operation that has a muxed source account (i.e. operation source account when set, transaction source account otherwise) will be rejected as invalid.

#### Emit a map as the `data` field in the `transfer` event if muxed information is being emitted.

The `data` field is currently an integer that represents the `amount`. If no muxed information is being emitted, this will not change. If we're emitting muxed information, then the `data` field on the `transfer` event will be an `SCVal` of type `SCV_MAP`. In
that case, the key for each map entry will be an `SCSymbol` with the name of the field in `data` (eg. "amount"), and the value will be represented by the types specified by the events below.

The general `transfer` event format that involves muxed accounts is `topics: ["transfer", from:<non-muxed ScAddress>, to:<non-muxed ScAddress>] data: { amount: i128, from_muxed_id:u64, to_muxed_id:u64|bytes|string }`, where at least one of `from_muxed_id` and `to_muxed_id` is present. The muxed accounts are always represented as a pair of (`non-muxed ScAddress`, `muxed_id`) , i.e the pair of (`from`, `from_muxed_id`) identifies the muxed transfer source and the pair of (`to`, `to_muxed_id`) identifies the muxed transfer destination. Non-muxed accounts are represented as a singular `from`/`to` value in the event topics and the respective `from_muxed_id`/`to_muxed_id` key won't be present in the `data` map.

The mapping between the input muxed addresses and the emitted events is generically defined as follows:

1. `MuxedAccount` (or `ScAddress` that wraps `MuxedAccount`, i.e `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_MUXED_ACCOUNT`) with `KEY_TYPE_MUXED_ED25519` variant set will be represented as a pair of `ScVal::SCV_ADDRESS` with `ScAddress` type `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_ACCOUNT` and the same `ed25519` key as in the `MuxedAccount`, and `ScVal::SCV_U64` `muxed_id` with the same value as the `id` field of the `MuxedAccount`.
2. If transaction memo is not `MEMO_NONE`, and the classic operation in the transaction has the transfer destination that is non-muxed classic account (i.e. is representable by `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_ACCOUNT` address), then the transfer event destination will be represented as a pair of `ScVal::SCV_ADDRESS` with `to` `ScAddress` type `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_ACCOUNT` and the same `ed25519` key as in the destination account, and an `to_muxed_id` `ScVal` containing the transaction memo. The memo is mapped to `ScVal` in the following fashion:
  - `MEMO_ID` is represented by `SCV_U64`
  - `MEMO_TEXT` is represented by `SCV_STRING`
  - `MEMO_HASH` and `MEMO_RETURN` are represented as `SCV_BYTES`, i.e. these memo types are indistinguishable in the event

Note, that the memo mapping rules above imply that in case if the destination of the transfer is not a classic account (i.e. a claimable balance, or liquidity pool), or a muxed account itself, then the transaction memo will not be represented in the unified events at all.

Here is how the rules above generally apply to the generated unified events (the event-specific sections also contain more detailed information where necessary):

- For `transfer` events coming directly from Soroban (i.e. from Stellar Asset contract) we will represent the input `KEY_TYPE_MUXED_ED25519` muxed account addresses according to the rule 1
- For the `transfer` events emitted due to non-Soroban value movement we make best-effort mapping based on the input `MuxedAccount`s and the transaction memo:
  - If the transfer source is a `MuxedAccount` with `KEY_TYPE_MUXED_ED25519`, then `from_muxed_id` will be emitted according to rule 1
  - If the transfer destination is a `MuxedAccount` with `KEY_TYPE_MUXED_ED25519`, then `to_muxed_id` will be emitted according to rule 1
  - If the transfer destination is a non-muxed classic account (i.e. `MuxedAccount` with `KEY_TYPE_ED25519` variant set), then emit `to_muxed_id` according to rule 2

### New Events for Representing Fees

For each transaction whose source account pays fees for the execution of a transaction, emit an event in the following format in the `contractEvents` field of the `TransactionMetaV4`:
```
contract: native asset, topics: ["fee", from:Address], data: [amount:i128]
```
Where `from` is the account paying the fee, either the fee bump fee account or the tx source account. This event should take the refund into account for Soroban transactions, so the amount on the event would be `initial fee charged - refund`.

### New Events for Operations
This section will go over the semantics of how the additional `transfer`/`mint`/`burn`/`clawback` events are emitted for each operation. These events will be emitted through the `events<>` field in the new `OperationMetaV2`. Soroban events will be moved to `OperationMetaV2`. The hash of the current soroban events will still exist under `INVOKE_HOST_FUNCTION_SUCCESS` as it does today. It's also important to note that nothing is being removed from meta, and in fact, the emission of the events (as well as the new meta version) mentioned in this section will be configurable through a flag.

Note that the `contract` field for these events corresponds to the Stellar Asset Contract address for the respective asset. The Stellar Asset Contract instance is not required to be deployed for the asset. The events will be published using the reserved contract address regardless of deployment status.

#### Payment
Emit one of the following events -

For a payment not involving the issuer, or if both the sender and receiver are the issuer:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

When sending from an issuer:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

When sending to an issuer:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), both `from_muxed_id` and `to_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map on the `transfer` event.


#### Path Payment Strict Send / Path Payment Strict Receive
For each movement of the asset created by the path payment, emit one of the following -

```
contract: assetA, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
contract: assetB, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

If `from` is the issuer on a side of the trade, emit the following instead for that side of the trade:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

If `to` is the issuer on a side of the trade, emit the following instead for that side of the trade:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account or the liquidity pool (represented by the new `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL` address type) being debited (seller).
* `to` is the account or liquidity pool (represented by the new `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL` address type) being credited (buyer).

The trades within a path payment are conceptually between the source account and the owner of the offers. Those are the addresses that'll appear on the event pairs specified above. At the end of all the trades, we need to emit one more `transfer` (or `burn` if the destination is the issuer) event to indicate a transfer from the source account to the destination account. The amount will be equivalent to the sum of the destination asset received on the trades of the final hop.

Note that if the path payment has an empty path and `sendAsset == destAsset`, then the operation is effectively a regular [payment](#payment), so emit an event following the specifications of the payment section.

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), both `from_muxed_id` and `to_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map on the `transfer` event. More specifically, if the source account is muxed and appears as `from` or `to` in an event, the respective `from_muxed_id` or `to_muxed_id` will be set. For the final event to the destination, if it is a `transfer`, `to_muxed_account` will be set if the `destination` is muxed, and if not, then it'll be set if the tx memo is set.

#### Create Account
Emit the following event:
```
contract: native asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited (creator).
* `to` is the account being credited (created).
* `amount` is the starting native balance.

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), both `from_muxed_id` and `to_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map. The `destination` on a `CreateAccountOp` can't be muxed, so `to_muxed_id`, will only be added to the data map if the transaction memo is set.

#### Merge Account
Emit the following event:
```
contract: native asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited (merged).
* `to` is the account being credited (merged into).
* `amount` is the merged native balance.

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), both `from_muxed_id` and `to_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map. 

#### Create Claimable Balance
Emit the following event:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* from is the account being debited.
* to is the claimable balance being created. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE`.
* amount is the amount moved into the claimable balance.

If an asset is a movement from the issuer of the asset, instead emit for the movement:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), `from_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map on the `transfer` event. The `to` address will be a claimable balance id, so it does not make sense to add the transaction memo into the event. Therefore, `to_muxed_id` will not be emitted in this case.

#### Claim Claimable Balance
Emit the following event:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```
* `from` is the claimable balance. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE`.
* `to` is the account being credited
* `amount` is the amount in the claimable balance

If the claim is a movement to the issuer of the asset, instead emit for the movement:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), `from_muxed_id` and `to_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map on the `transfer` event.  The `destination` on a claimable balances `claimant` cannot be muxed, so `to_muxed_id` will only be added to the data map if the transaction memo is set.

#### Liquidity Pool Deposit
Emit the following events:
```
contract: assetA, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
contract: assetB, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited.
* `to` is the liquidity pool being credited. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL`.
* `amount` is the amount moved into the liquidity pool.

If an asset is a movement from the issuer of the asset, instead emit for the movement:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), `from_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map on the `transfer` event. The `to` address will be a liquidity pool id, so it does not make sense to add the transaction memo into the event. Therefore, `to_muxed_id` will not be emitted in this case.

#### Liquidity Pool Withdraw
Emit the following events:
```
contract: assetA, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
contract: assetB, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the liquidity pool. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL`.
* `to` is the account being credited.
* `amount` is the amount moved out of the liquidity pool.


If an asset is issued by the withdrawer, instead emit for the movement of the issued asset:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), `to_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map on the `transfer` event. The `from` address will be a liquidity pool id, so it does not make sense to add the transaction memo into the event. Therefore, `from_muxed_id` will not be emitted in this case.

#### Manage Buy Offer / Manage Sell Offer / Create Passive Sell Offer
Emit two events per offer traded against. Each pair of events represents both sides of a trade. This does mean zero events can be emitted if the resulting offer is not marketable - 

```
contract: assetA, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
contract: assetB, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

If `from` is the issuer on a side of the trade, emit the following instead for that side of the trade:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

If `to` is the issuer on a side of the trade, emit the following instead for that side of the trade:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited (seller).
* `to` is the account being credited (buyer).

As specified in the [section to update the transfer events data field](#emit-a-map-as-the-data-field-in-the-transfer-event-if-muxed-information-is-being-emitted), both `from_muxed_id` and `to_muxed_id` can be added to the `data` map on the `transfer` event. More specifically, if the source account is muxed and appears as `from` or `to` in an event, the respective `from_muxed_id` or `to_muxed_id` will be set.

#### Clawback / Clawback Claimable Balance
Emit the following event:

```
contract: asset, topics: ["clawback", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account or claimable balance being debited.
* `amount` is the amount being moved out of the account and burned.


#### Allow Trust / Set Trustline Flags
If either operation is used to revoke authorization from a trustline that deposited into a liquidity pool then claimable balances can be created for the withdrawn assets (See [CAP-0038](cap-0038.md#SetTrustLineFlagsOp-and-AllowTrustOp) for more info). If any claimable balances are created due to this scenario, emit the following event for each claimable balance:

```
contract: asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the liquidity pool. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL`.
* `to` is the claimable balance being created. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE`.
* `amount` is the amount moved into the claimable balance.

If the an asset in the liquidity pool is being withdrawn for the issuer, then no claimable balance will be created for that asset, so instead emit a burn event - 
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

Due to the fact that `from` and `to` are liquidity pool id's and claimable balance id's respectively, we will not emit a `from_muxed_id` or `to_muxed_id` in the `transfer` event.

#### Inflation
Emit a `mint` event for each inflation winner:

```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `to` is one of the winning account addresses.
* `amount` is the amount of the native asset won.

### Retroactively emitting events
The events specified above not only need to be emitted going forward, but also on replay for all ledgers from genesis so balances can be built from events. Some Stellar Asset Contract events are also being updated (removing the admin from `mint`/`clawback`, and emitting `mint`/`burn` instead of `transfer` when the issuer if `from` or `to`). Due to the fact that Soroban events are hashed into the ledger, we will continue to emit Stellar Asset Contract events as they were emitted in previous protocols. This will, however, cause issues with rebuilding balances on replay, so there will be a configuration flag added that will result in [V20,V22] events being emitted in the V23 format for the scenarios just mentioned. This does mean that the events can't be used to verify the hash of the events in `InvokeHostFunctionResult`, but this flag will be disabled by default.

Another relevant detail for replaying events is that prior to protocol 8, there was a bug that could result in the minting/burning of XLM. To allow for the ability to build balances with only events, we not only need to emit the events specified in this CAP from genesis, but also handle that bug properly.

For both the mint and burn scenario, the affected account will be the source account, and that should be the only account in an operation with a balance difference not entirely reflected by the events specified in this CAP. If we take the total diff of XLM in an `Operations` `OperationMeta` (similar to what the ConservationOfLumens invariant does) and emit that diff as a mint/burn event for the source account, then consumers should be able to track balances correctly.

## Design Rationale

### Remove the admin from the SAC `mint` and `clawback` events

The admin isn't relevant information when a mint or `clawback` occurs, and it hinders compatibility with SEP-41 for when these two events are added to it because the admin is an implementation detail. For a custom token, an admin doesn't need to be a single `Address`, or an admin may not required at all to emit either event.

### TransactionMetaV4

This CAP introduces a new `TransactionMeta` version, `TransactionMetaV4`. Now that we're emitting events for more than just Soroban, this allows us to clean up the structure of meta because `TransactionMetaV3` assumed events would only be emitted for Soroban. This change also allows us to emit events at the operation layer instead of the transaction layer using the new `OperationMetaV2` type. Transaction level events like `fee` will still be emitted at the transaction level under `TransactionMetaV4.events`.

It's important to note that transaction meta is not part of the protocol, so the emission of `TransactionMetaV4` instead of `TransactionMetaV3` can be done using a config flag, allowing consumers of meta to switch on their own time.

### Emit the semantically correct event instead of no longer allowing the issuer to transfer due to missing a trustline

The Stellar Asset Contract special cases the issuer logic because issuers can't hold a trustline for their own assets. This matches the logic in Classic. The special case was unnecessary however because the Stellar Asset Contract provides the `mint` and `burn` functions. This CAP could instead just remove the special case and allow `transfers` involving the issuer to fail due to a missing trustline,
but this would break any contracts that rely on this behavior (it's not known at this time if contracts like this exist, but we could check if there are any `transfers` on pubnet that involve the issuer). That's why this CAP chooses to instead emit the correct event in this scenario.

### Classic events will not be hashed into the ledger

For now, the new events being added for the non-soroban operations will not be hashed into the ledger to give us more flexibility while we figure out if we want to transform more of the meta ledger entry changes into events. We can start hashing the events at a later point. Soroban events will continued to be hashed as they are in protocol 22.

### New SCAddressType types

This CAP adds two new `SCAddressType` types - `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE` and `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL`. These types are used in the topic of an event where the address is not a contract or a stellar account.

### Make Soroban transactions with `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS` along with a memo or muxed source account invalid

Soroban authorization payloads with `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS` do not sign the tx memo, so continuing to allow this is potentially unsafe. This CAP introduces a way to specify a memo for Soroban transaction, so there's no need to put the effort into adding the transaction memo to Soroban authorization with [CAP-0064](./cap-0064.md).

### Order of precedence for `to_muxed_id` on the `transfer` event

The `transfer` event can emit muxed information for both `from` and `to`, where the transaction memo will be forwarded to `to_muxed_id` for classic if the destination is not muxed, but the CAP has specified that if the destination is muxed and the transaction memo is set for classic events, then we set `to_muxed_id` using an order of precedence. We use the destinations muxed information over the transaction memo. The alternative was to also emit a transaction level `tx_memo` event, but we determined that this was not necessary as setting both a muxed destination account and a tx memo is an edge case without a relevant use case. If a consumer wants the tx memo as well, they can just look for it in the transaction.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition
On the protocol upgrade, the SAC will start emitting the `mint` and `clawback` events without the `admin` topic. Also, the `transfer` event will not be emitted for `transfers` involving the issuer. Instead, the appropriate `mint`/`burn` will be emitted.

The unified events will not be part of the protocol, so they can be enabled with a configuration flag at anytime.

### Backwards Incompatibilities


### Resource Utilization
The additional events will use more resources if a node chooses to emit them.
