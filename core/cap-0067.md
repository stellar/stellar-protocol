Protocol version: 23
```

## Simple Summary

Emit `transfer`, `mint`, `burn`, `clawback`, and `fee` events in Classic in the same format as what we see in Soroban so that the movement of assets can be tracked using a single stream of data. In addition to emitting events in Classic, update the events emitted in the Stellar Asset Contract to be semantically correct and compatible with SEP-41.

## Motivation

Tracking the movement of Stellar assets today is complex because you need to consume both Soroban events emitted by the Stellar Asset Contract and ledger entry changes for Classic operations. There are also differences between Stellar assets and custom Soroban tokens that this CAP will address so those differences will be made irrelevant to the end user.

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

  - The Stellar Network should be secure and reliable, and should bias towards safety, simplicity,
  reliability, and performance over new functionality.

## Abstract

This CAP specifies three changes - 
1. Emit an event for every movement of an `Asset` of types `ASSET_TYPE_NATIVE`, `ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM4`, and `ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM12`. in Stellar classic. All of the added events will follow the format of the existing Stellar Asset Contract events, with the exception of a new `fee` event to track fees paid by the source account. 
2. Remove the admin from the topics of the `mint` and `clawback` events emitted in the SAC.
3. Update issuer semantics in the SAC so that a `transfer` involving the issuer will emit the semantically correct event (`mint` or `burn`).

## Specification

## Semantics

### Remove the admin from the SAC `mint` and `clawback` events

The `mint` event will look like:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

The `clawback` event will look like:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["clawback", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

### Emit the semantically correct event for a Stellar Asset Contract `transfer` when the issuer is involved 

At the moment, if the issuer is the sender in a Stellar Asset Contract `transfer`, the asset will be minted. If the issuer is the recipient, the asset will be burned. The event emitted in both scenarios, however, is the `transfer` event. This CAP changes that behavior to instead emit the `mint`/`burn` event.

### New Events
This section will go over the semantics of how the additional `transfer` events are emitted for each operation, as well as the `fee` event emitted for the fee paid by the source account. These events will be emitted through the `events<>` field in the new `OperationMetaV2`, and the SHA-256 hash of the events will be saved in `eventsHash<>` which is in the new `TransactionResultExtensionV1` extension of `TransactionResult`. For consistency, the preimage of the hash stored in `InvokeHostFunctionResult` on success will just be the `returnValue` `SCVal`, and the events hash will be stored in `eventsHash` like any other transaction. Soroban events will also be emitted through `OperationMetaV2`.

Note that the `contract` field for these events corresponds to the Stellar Asset Contract address for the respective asset. Note that the Stellar Asset Contract instance is not required to be deployed for the asset. The events will be published using the reserved contract address regardless of deployment status.

#### Fees paid by source account

For each transaction whose source account pays fees for the execution of a transaction, emit an event in the following format:
```
contract: native asset, topics: ["fee", from:Address], data: [amount:i128]
```
Where from is the account paying the fee, either the fee bump fee account or the tx source account.

#### Payment
Emit one of the following events -

For a payment not involving the issuer, or if both the sender and receiver are the issuer:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

When sending from an issuer:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

When sending to an issuer:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

#### Path Payment Strict Send / Path Payment Strict Receive
For each movement of the asset created by the path payment, emit one of the following -

```
contract: assetA, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
contract: assetB, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

If `from` is the issuer on a side of the trade, emit the following instead for that side of the trade:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

If `to` is the issuer on a side of the trade, emit the following instead for that side of the trade:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited (seller).
* `to` is the account being credited (buyer).

The trades within a path payment are conceptually between the source account and the owner of the offers. Those are the addresses that'll appear on the event pairs specified above. At the end of all the trades, we need to emit one more `transfer` (or `burn` if the destination is the issuer) event to indicate a transfer from the source account to the destination account. The amount will be equivalent to the sum of the destination asset received on the trades of the final hop.

Note that if the path payment has an empty path and `sendAsset == destAsset`, then the operation is effectively a regular [payment](#payment), so emit an event following the specifications of the payment section.


#### Create Account
Emit the following event:
```
contract: native asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited (creator).
* `to` is the account being credited (created).
* `amount` is the starting native balance.

#### Merge Account
Emit the following event:
```
contract: native asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited (merged).
* `to` is the account being credited (merged into).
* `amount` is the merged native balance.

#### Create Claimable Balance
Emit the following event:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* from is the account being debited.
* to is the claimable balance being created. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE`.
* amount is the amount moved into the claimable balance.

If an asset is a movement from the issuer of the asset, instead emit for the movement:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

#### Claim Claimable Balance
Emit the following event:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```
* `from` is the claimable balance. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE`.
* `to` is the account being credited
* `amount` is the amount in the claimable balance

If the claim is a movement to the issuer of the asset, instead emit for the movement:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

#### Liquidity Pool Deposit
Emit the following events:
```
contract: assetA, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
contract: assetB, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited.
* `to` is the liquidity pool being credited. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL`.
* `amount` is the amount moved into the liquidity pool.

If an asset is a movement from the issuer of the asset, instead emit for the movement:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

#### Liquidity Pool Withdraw
Emit the following events:
```
contract: assetA, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
contract: assetB, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the liquidity pool. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL`.
* `to` is the account being credited.
* `amount` is the amount moved out of the liquidity pool.


If an asset is issued by the withdrawer, instead emit for the movement of the issued asset:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

#### Manage Buy Offer / Manage Sell Offer / Create Passive Sell Offer
Emit two events per offer traded against. Each pair of events represents both sides of a trade. This does mean zero events can be emitted if the resulting offer is not marketable - 

```
contract: assetA, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
contract: assetB, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

If `from` is the issuer on a side of the trade, emit the following instead for that side of the trade:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["mint", to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

If `to` is the issuer on a side of the trade, emit the following instead for that side of the trade:
```
contract: asset, topics: ["burn", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account being debited (seller).
* `to` is the account being credited (buyer).

#### Clawback / Clawback Claimable Balance
Emit the following event:

```
contract: asset, topics: ["clawback", from:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the account or claimable balance being credited.
* `amount` is the amount being moved out of the account and burned.


#### Allow Trust / Set Trustline Flags
If either operation is used to revoke authorization from a trustline that deposited into a liquidity pool then claimable balances will be created for the withdrawn assets (See [CAP-0038](cap-0038.md#SetTrustLineFlagsOp-and-AllowTrustOp) for more info). If any claimable balances are created due to this scenario, emit the following event:

```
contract: asset, topics: ["transfer", from:Address, to:Address, sep0011_asset:String], data: amount:i128
```

* `from` is the liquidity pool. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL`.
* `to` is the claimable balance being created. The type of this address will be `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE`.
* `amount` is the amount moved into the claimable balance.

## Design Rationale

### Remove the admin from the SAC `mint` and `clawback` events

The admin isn't relevant information when a mint or `clawback` occurs, and it hinders compatibility with SEP-41 for when these two events are added to it because the admin is an implementation detail. For a custom token, an admin doesn't need to be a single `Address`, or an admin may not required at all to emit either event.

### TransactionMetaV4

This CAP introduces a new `TransactionMeta` version, `TransactionMetaV4`. Now that we're emitting events for more than just Soroban, this allows us to clean up the structure of meta because `TransactionMetaV3` assumed events would only be emitted for Soroban. This change also allows us to emit events at the operation layer instead of the transaction layer using the new `OperationMetaV2` type.

It's important to note that transaction meta is not part of the protocol, so the emission of `TransactionMetaV4` instead of `TransactionMetaV3` can be done using a config flag, allowing consumers of meta to switch on their own time.

### Emit the semantically correct event instead of no longer allowing the issuer to transfer due to missing a trustline

The Stellar Asset Contract special cases the issuer logic because issuers can't hold a trustline for their own assets. This matches the logic in Classic. The special case was unnecessary however because the Stellar Asset Contract provides the `mint` and `burn` functions. This CAP could instead just remove the special case and allow `transfers` involving the issuer to fail due to a missing trustline,
but this would break any contracts that rely on this behavior (it's not known at this time if contracts like this exist, but we could check if there are any `transfers` on pubnet that involve the issuer). That's why this CAP chooses to instead emit the correct event in this scenario.

### New SCAddressType types

This CAP adds two new `SCAddressType` types - `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE` and `SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL`. These types are used in the topic of an event where the address is not a contract or a stellar account.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition
On the protocol upgrade, the SAC will start emitting the `mint` and `clawback` events without the `admin` topic. Also, the `transfer` event will not be emitted for `transfers` involving the issuer. Instead, the appropriate `mint`/`burn` will be emitted.

The unified events will not be part of the protocol, so they can be enabled with a configuration flag at anytime.

### Backwards Incompatibilities


### Resource Utilization
The additional events will use more resources if a node chooses to emit them.
