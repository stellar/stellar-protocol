## Simple Summary

This proposal introduces a new resource type for Soroban reads, distinguishing between in-memory and
disk reads. This also proposes automatic restoration for archived entries via `InvokeHostFunctionOp`.

## Working Group

As specified in the Preamble.

## Motivation

By distinguishing disk and in-memory reads, this proposal allows for significant increase in Soroban
read limits. This distinction also allows for safe automatic entry restoration, significantly improving UX.

### Goals Alignment

This change is aligned with the goal of lowering the cost and increasing the scale of the network.

## Abstract

[CAP-0062](cap-0062.md) introduces partial State Archival, where evicted and live Soroban state is stored in separate databases.
This separation allows live Soroban state to be efficiently cached entirely in memory, removing disc reads entirely for all
live Soroban state. Todays eviction scan can then delete entries from both the live BucketList disk and in-memory cache efficiently.
However, classic state and evicted entries are still subject to disk reads.

This CAP introduces a new resource type for reads, distinguishing between disk reads and in-memory reads. By making this
distinction at the protocol level, read limits for Soroban data can greatly increase. This also opens the door for other
optimizations, such as a complete module cache for all live contracts.

Additionally, this CAP introduces automatic restoration via `InvokeHostFunctionOp`, where any archived key present in the
footprint is automatically restored. Initially in protocol 20, the state archival design was not solidified enough to
enable automatic restoration, so an explicit restore operation was required. While this was not technically required in
protocol 20, it was important for contract interfaces to reason properly about restoration such that when full state
archival was introduce, it would not break preexisting deployments. Given that the full State Archival design has been
mostly finalized in [CAP-0057](cap-0057.md), it is now appropriate to introduce automatic restoration.

### Semantics

#### In-memory vs Disk Read Resources

Read resources are now separated between memory backed and disk backed state as follows:

- in-memory entries:
  - Live Soroban entries
  - Archived entries that have not yet been evicted (i.e. still exist in the live BucketList)
- disk entries:
  - Archived Soroban entries that have been evicted
  - Classic entries

In-memory entries are subject to the corresponding in-memory limits, but charge no entry or byte based
read fees. On disk entries are subject to the corresponding limits and also charge entry and byte based
read fees.

Note that while read resources and fees have changed, write semantics have not. Writes to both entry
types have the same fee and limits as protocol 22.

#### Initial Network Config Settings

Initially, all disk read limits and fees should match exactly the limits and fees of reads today. Limits must not
decrease from current values in order to prevent bricking existing contracts. In the worst case, a contract can read
up to `txMaxReadEntries - 2` classic entries today (all classic entries + wasm + instance). Current limits have been
carefully measured assuming disk access only, so the addition of in-memory state should not negatively affect the network
in any way should we maintain these values via disk read limits.

TODO:  In-memory read entries must be measured in order to find a reasonable starting point.

#### `evictedEntries` Vector

For the purposes of block creation, the `LedgerKey` alone is sufficient to distinguish between classic and Soroban data.
However, a disk read would be required prior to tx application in order to determine if a Soroban entry was live or evicted.
This is necessary for determining what resources limits a Soroban key counts towards, but
exposes a significant DOS angle. To prevent this attack, the footprint must statically declare which entries are live vs. evicted.

This is accomplished via the `evictedEntries` vector. If any evicted Soroban entry is present in a TX's footprint,
it must provide the `evictedEntries` vector containing the index of each evicted key based on the ordering of the
readWrite footprint. Because restores are a write operation, no evicted key should be in the readOnly footprint. This vector
should contain no classic key indexes, as classic keys are always considered disk reads.

#### Changes to `InvokeHostFunctionOp`

##### Automatic Entry Restoration

Whenever `InvokeHostFunctionOp` is applied, any archived state is
automatically restored prior to host function invocation. This restored state is then accessible to the host function.

Restored state is still subject to the same minimum rent and write fees that exist currently.

If an archived Soroban entry has not yet been evicted and still exists in the live BucketList, it is metered and charged based
on in-memory read limits and fees. If an archived Soroban entry has been evicted, it is metered and charged based
on on-disk limits and fees. All evicted keys must be declared in the `evictedEntries` vector via `SorobanResourcesExtV0`.
If no evicted entries are present in the footprint, `SorobanResourcesExtV0` may be omitted.

##### Incorrect Entries in `evictedEntries` Vector

If a key is not marked as evicted, but the entry is actually evicted, then the TX fails. If a Soroban key is marked as evicted when
it is not, the transaction does not fail. The entry is treated as if it is evicted from a resource and fee perspective.
This is appropriate, as on disk reads are more expensive than in-memory. So long as the TX pays the disk based fees,
there is no issue with actually loading an in-memory entry.

If a classic key is marked as evicted, the TX fails, as the footprint is malformed.

##### Failure Codes

If an evicted entry is included in the TX's footprint but is not specified via the `evictedEntries` vector, the
tx will fail with the `INVOKE_HOST_FUNCTION_ENTRY_ARCHIVED` code. If there are insufficient resources for entry restoration,
the tx will fail with the `INVOKE_HOST_FUNCTION_RESOURCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` code.

If a classic entry is marked as evicted, the TX fails with `INVOKE_HOST_FUNCTION_MALFORMED` during apply time.

##### Meta

Whenever an entry is restored, it will be emitted as a `LedgerEntryChangeType` of type `LEDGER_ENTRY_RESTORE`.
This will include the complete LedgerEntry of the restored entry. It does not matter if the entry has been
evicted or not, the meta produced will be the same.

If a restored entry is modified during host function invocation, another `LedgerEntryChangeType` will be
emitted corresponding to the entry change in addition to the `LEDGER_ENTRY_RESTORE` restore event.
This is similar to the current meta schema, where the starting value of a LedgerEntry is emitted as
`LEDGER_ENTRY_STATE` followed by the change. This is similar, except that `LEDGER_ENTRY_STATE` is replaced
by `LEDGER_ENTRY_RESTORE`.

#### Deprecation of RestoreFootprintOp(?)

With the addition of automatic restoration, there is currently no need for `RestoreFootprintOp`. Functionally, the same automatic
restoration behavior that exists in `InvokeHostFunctionOp` could be replicated in `ExtendFootprintTTLOp` to provide a single
"admin" op type for managing lifetimes and restoration.

Currently, `ExtendFootprintTTLOp` is rarely called, as most rent management is performed via contract calls. With the addition of
automatic restoration, I expect that `RestoreFootprintOp` will also be rarely invoked. It may make sense from a maintenance and UX
perspective to deprecate `RestoreFootprintOp` in favor of a single op type.

#### getledgerentry Endpoint

In order to facilitate state queries for RPC preflight, captive-core will expose the following HTTP endpoint:

`getledgerentry`

Used to query both live and archived LedgerEntries. While `getledgerentryraw` does simple key-value lookup
on the live ledger, `getledgerentry` will query a given key in both the live BucketList and Hot Archive BucketList.
It will also report whether an entry is archived, evicted, or live, and return the entry's current TTL value.

A POST request with the following body:

```http
ledgerSeq=NUM&key=Base64&key=Base64...
```

- `ledgerSeq`: An optional parameter, specifying the ledger snapshot to base the query on.
  If the specified ledger in not available, a 404 error will be returned. If this parameter
  is not set, the current ledger is used.
- `key`: A series of Base64 encoded XDR strings specifying the `LedgerKey` to query. TTL keys
  must not be queried and will return 400 if done so.

A JSON payload is returned as follows:

```json
{
"entries": [
     {"e": "Base64-LedgerEntry", "state": "live", /*optional*/ "ttl": uint32},
     {"e": "Base64-LedgerKey", "state": "new"},
     {"e": "Base64-LedgerEntry", "state": "archived"},
     {"e": "Base64-LedgerEntry", "state": "evicted"}
],
"ledger": ledgerSeq
}
```

- `entries`: A list of entries for each queried LedgerKey. Every `key` queried is guaranteed to
have a corresponding entry returned.
- `e`: Either the `LedgerEntry` or `LedgerKey` for a given key encoded as a Base64 string. If a key
is live or archived, `e` contains the corresponding `LedgerEntry`. If a key does not exist
(including expired temporary entries) `e` contains the corresponding `LedgerKey`.
- `state`: One of the following values:
  - `live`: Entry is live.
  - `new`: Entry does not exist. Either the entry has never existed or is an expired temp entry.
  - `archived`: Entry is archived, but not yet evicted, counts towards in-memory resources.
  - `evicted`: Entry is archived and evicted, counts towards disk resources.
- `ttl`: An optional value, only returned for live Soroban entries. Contains
a uint32 value for the entry's `liveUntilLedgerSeq`.
- `ledgerSeq`: The ledger number on which the query was performed.

Classic entries will always return a state of `live` or `new`.
If a classic entry does not exist, it will have a state of `new`.

Similarly, temporary Soroban entries will always return a state of `live` or
`new`. If a temporary entry does not exist or has expired, it
will have a state of `new`.

This endpoint will always give correct information for archived entries. Even
if an entry has been archived and evicted to the Hot Archive, this endpoint will
still the archived entry's full `LedgerEntry` as well as the proper state.

## Design Rationale

### Reasoning behind in-memory limits and no fees

While there is a resource limit for the maximum number of in-memory entry reads, there is no limit on the
number of in-memory read bytes. Additionally, there are no read-specific fees for in-memory state.

There does not seem to be a need for limits on in-memory bytes read. The cost associated with loading an
in-memory entry is searching an in-memory map and making a copy of the LedgerEntry. Given that there is a limit
on the maximum number of in-memory entries, and given that there is a limit on the maximum size for each entry,
it seems highly unlikely that an attacker would be able to DOS the network via in-memory entry copies.

Given that in-memory state lookups are cheap, it also does not seem necessary to have an explicit fee for
in-memory reads. In-memory reads will already be implicitly charged fees due to instruction and memory costs
associated with interacting with the entry. An attacker could potentially exploit these implicit fees
by creating TXs with large readOnly footprints that don't actually interact with the loaded state. The
TX would consume little resources and would be cheap, but would load the maximum amount of in-memory state
and avoid these implicit fees. Due to the low cost of these loads, it seems unlikely this would negatively
affect the network. Even the TX size costs associated with the large footprint may make the attack economically
nonviable relative to the amount of stress on the network. However, if this were to become an issue,
this could be solved in implementation. For example, instead of passing copies of state to the VM, const
pointers to readOnly state could be used.

### UX Expectations

With the addition of the new read resource type, contract developers will need to reason about what types of data
they are accessing wrt limits. However, the system has been designed such that this should be straight forward.
From a correctness standpoint, all smart contracts can be guaranteed to only interact with live state. A contract
developer can assume that all Soroban state consumes only in-memory resources, since the `RestoreFootprintOp`
(or equivalent in the case of deprecation) can restore all required Soroban entries before host function invocation
in the worst case. This means that from a limits perspective, only Soroban state vs. classic state must be considered
for contract correctness. However, there may be issues with usability or efficiency, discussed in the section below.

While contract developers only need to distinguish between Soroban and classic state for contract correctness, the
tx itself will still need to properly populate limits and the `evictedEntries` vector based on whether or not
entries are archived. Similar to today, these resources and footprints will be generated automatically via RPC.
Specifically, RPC will correctly generate the footprint, `evictedEntries` vector, in-memory read resources,
and disk read resources. Thus most of the complexity introduced by these changes should be abstracted away.

Note that the RPC itself is not required to implement this behavior, but will call captive-core endpoints.

### Host Functions that are too expensive for automatic restore

Suppose an expensive contract is written, such that it uses the maximum in-memory resources and the maximum
disk resources when no entries are evicted. Should any Soroban entry be evicted, automatic
restoration would not be possible, as the restoration would exceed resource limits. In this case, it would be
necessary to manually issue a `RestoreFootprintOp` (or equivalent in the case of deprecation) prior to the
host function invocation.

Ideally, this should be avoided if possible. The challenge will be communicating this to developers. This may be accomplished
via documentation. Additionally, RPC could provide a warning to developers when the submitted invocation would
exceed network limits should a sufficient amount of state restoration be required. This may help developers catch this
class of performance issue earlier in the development process.

Despite warning and documentation, there will be expensive contracts that are not compatible with automatic restore
in all cases. For this reason, RPC preflight must be able to distinguish whether automatic restore is possible for a
given invocation. If it is not, preflight must return the appropriate `restorePreamble` and communicate that an
explicit restoration is required before function invocation.

### Expectations for Downstream Systems

RPC must make the following changes:

1. Ingest the new `LEDGER_ENTRY_RESTORE` restore changes. This includes interpreting the new `LedgerEntryChangeType`
correctly, but also correctly handling the case where an entry is restored and modified in the same ledger.
2. Distinguish between live and evicted Soroban state during preflight in order to populate the new resource types
and populate the `evictedEntries` vector.
3. Notify users if a given preflighted transaction will not be able to be automatically restored due to resource limits,
and provide a restore preamble for manual restoration in these cases.
4. Allow user queries for both live and evicted state via the `getledgerentry` endpoint.

Change 1 should be straight forward and is defined in the [InvokeHostFunctionOp Meta](#meta) section.

For change 2, the construction of the footprint, resources, and evicted keys vector will be handled by the simulation
library. However, RPC will need to input a given LedgerEntry and its eviction state (whether or not it is evicted)
to the simulation library. RPC can accomplish this by utilizing the captive-core [`getledgerentry` HTTP endpoint](#getledgerentry-endpoint).

Change 3 is largely an interface problem. The simulation library is responsible for detecting whether or not
automatic restoration will violate current network limits and if a manual restore op is required. It is then
the responsibility of RPC to forward this information to the user in an actionable way. It may also be useful
to warn a user if a given transaction could in the future require manual restoration, even if it is not the case
with the current ledger state.

Change 4 allows wallets to effectively reason about ledger state. RPC integration is minimal, as internally
this endpoint can be implemented by calling the captive-core [`getledgerentry` HTTP endpoint](#getledgerentry-endpoint).

### Concerns regarding Automatic Restoration with Full State Archival

In protocol 20, there was no technical reason against enabling automatic restoration. However, the proof system
for full state archival was not finalized, and the explicit `RestoreFootprintOp` provided more future flexibility.
Additionally, it was important for developers to build preflighting transactions into their dApp flows.

If Soroban had launched with automatic restoration, it is possible many developers would attempt to avoid preflight
by creating transaction footprint and resource declarations manually with reasonable fee and resource assumptions.
In a system where explicit entry restoration is not required, the burden of resource discoverability is low, so
developers are not incentivized or required to build preflight into their tx submission system. Long term this is
a significant issue, as the addition of full state archival with proofs makes manual resource and footprint
declaration largely impossible. Any system that did not use RPC preflight would be broken by full state archival.

With this proposal, it is vital to ensure that automatic restore does not result in a situation where large numbers
of developers circumvent preflight. Two specific features of this proposal help ensure developers are incentivized
to build preflight into their flows now such that they are not broken later by archival proofs. Specifically,
no in-memory read fees incentivize developers to minimize fees by using preflight to detect the maximum
number of entries currently live. Additionally, the requirement of `evictedEntries` vectors makes manually
constructing footprints challenging, as the developer would need to be able to distinguish live vs evicted state
to minimize fees. Given that preflighting will result in lower on-chain fees, and given that resource footprints
are somewhat challenging to create without captive-core seems to indicate that developers will preflight transactions
prior to submission as intended.

## Security Concerns

### Memory Based DOS Attack

By distinguishing between disk backed and memory backed reads at the protocol level, it is now required that
validators maintain all live Soroban state in memory. A significant increase in live Soroban state could
lead to an OOM based attack on the network.

However, this is not a significant concern. The `sorobanLiveStateTargetSizeBytes` (see [CAP-0062](cap-0062.md))
provides a soft cap on the amount of live Soroban state that can exist at any given time. This prevents any
sort of runaway memory issue. Additionally, because of the eviction process, there is a natural back pressure
applied to in-memory state, the rate at which can be controlled via network config settings. Finally, the rate
at which new state is created is also controlled via network configs, so there does not appear to be any
memory based DOS attack possible.
