## Simple Summary
This is a CAP describing new Soroban host functions for conversion between `String` and `Bytes` types in Soroban.

## Working Group

As described in the preamble section.

## Motivation

`String` host type is basically an alias to the `Bytes` type as it doesn't enforce any specific encoding to be used.  However, the only way to convert between the two is to allocate a buffer of arbitrary length in the linear memory of the contract, which is rather inefficient as it requires the contract to link the allocator library which might be otherwise not necessary. Conversion between the compatible types is a generally useful feature to provide (e.g. for connecting different contract APIs), but the additional motivation in this is case is also the fact that the set of the host functions defined for `Bytes` is much broader than the one for `String`.


### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

  - The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects
    to create highly usable products

## Abstract
The following new host functions are provided:

- A function that converts a `BytesObject` into `StringObject` with the same contents
- A function that converts a `StringObject` into `BytesObject` with the same contents

## Specification

### New host functions

The diff is based on commit `822727b37b7ef2eea1fc0bafc558820dc450c67e` of `rs-soroban-env`.

### Semantics

`string_to_bytes`/`bytes_to_string` functions will be added to Soroban host. These functions perform the `StringObject`<->`BytesObject` conversions. Both allocate a new object of the respective output type from the underlying bytes buffer without performing any additional validation.

While there is room for optimization here via using the shared bytes buffer, this CAP doesn't go for it as the benefit is too marginal compared to the necessary effort.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

The proposed host functions will use the standard mechanism for protocol-gating the host functions and will become available in protocol 23. Before protocol 23 it will be impossible to upload Wasm that uses the new functions.

### Backwards Incompatibilities

This CAP does not introduce any backward incompatibilities.

### Resource Utilization

The new host functions will have the appropriate metering. No new cost types need to be introduced, as the operations can lean on the existing metering primitives.

## Security Concerns

None.
