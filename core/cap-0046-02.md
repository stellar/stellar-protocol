## Simple Summary

This proposal defines the structure of smart contracts on Stellar and specifies
how users can create them.

## Motivation and Goals Alignment

See the Soroban overview CAP.

## Abstract

Users need a way to manage smart contracts on the network. This CAP allows users
to deploy the smart contracts to the network and specifies the supported
contract code kinds.

## Specification

### XDR

See the XDR diffs in the Soroban overview CAP, specifically those referring to
`HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT` and
`HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_UPLOAD_CONTRACT_WASM`.

## Semantics

### Contract structure

This defines the terms we use in the following sections without going into their
design and implementation details.

#### Contract source

Contract source can be thought of as a 'class' of a contract. Multiple contracts
can share the same source, but have their own state. Thanks to that sharing
capability, we can reduce the amount of duplication in ledger and only store
unique contract sources.

This CAP defines two possible kinds of contract sources:

- Wasm source: a blob of Wasm code that is stored in a separate ledger entry and
  is deduplicated based on contents. This is uploaded to ledger by the users.
- Built-in contract: this is a 'source' compiled into host directly that has a
  protocol-defined interface and behavior.

#### Contract executable

The Contract executable contains a pointer to the Wasm source or a tag of a built-in
contract.

#### Contract instance

Contract instance can be thought of as an instance of the contract 'class'.
Contract instance consists of:

- A `ContractExecutable`.
- An optional `SCMap*` for users to store data
that should be tied to the lifetime of the instance (./cap-0046-02.md).

A contract instance may own an arbitrary amount of ledger entries attributed to
its identifier. Contracts that share the same source in no way may influence
each other; from the perspective of a contract invoker there is no difference
between calling the contracts with the same or different source references
(besides the possible contract-defined behavior differences).

### Contract identifier preimage type

`ENVELOPE_TYPE_CONTRACT_ID` is the `HashIDPreimage` type used for contract
identifiers. This unique tag is what ensures that there are no collisions with
other hashes in the protocol. It contains the `Hash` of the `networkID` to
ensure that every network has unique set of contract identifiers, along with a
`ContractIDPreimage`, which is a union that supports both
`CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ADDRESS` and `CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ASSET`.
- `CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ADDRESS`: built from an an `SCAddress` and the
  user-specified `uint256` salt.
- `CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ASSET`: built from a Stellar `Asset`
  structure.

### Uploading Wasm sources using `InvokeHostFunctionOp`

Wasm contract sources can be uploaded to the network without instantiating a
contract via `InvokeHostFunctionOp`(defined in [CAP-0046-04](./cap-0046-04.md))
with `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_UPLOAD_CONTRACT_WASM` host function type in
`hostFunction`.

This function accepts `opaque wasm<>` that contains the Wasm
contract code.

Uploaded contracts are stored in `ContractCodeEntry` ledger entries. These
entries are keyed by the hash of the Wasm used to upload
them.

The contract upload host function will compute the hash of
the Wasm and check if such a contract code already exists. If
the entry exists, the operation will immediately succeed. If it doesn't, the
new `ContractCodeEntry` will be created.

Core does not perform any validation on the uploaded contract code, besides
checking its size.

#### Max contract size setting

The maximum Wasm contract size will be introduced as a `ConfigSettingEntry`(see
[CAP-0046-09](./cap-0046-09.md) for details on config entries). 

It is set during the protocol version upgrade using a new `ConfigSettingEntry`,
with `configSettingID` == `CONFIG_SETTING_CONTRACT_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`, and
`contractMaxSizeBytes` == `65536`. The valid values for
`contractMaxSizeBytes` are [5000, UINT32_MAX] (inclusive).

### Instantiating contracts using `InvokeHostFunctionOp`

Contracts can be instantiated via `InvokeHostFunctionOp` with
`HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT` host function type.

The function accepts `CreateContractArgs` struct that defines the input for
building the contract identifier preimage (`contractIDPreimage` field) and the
contract executable reference (`executable` field).

`InvokeHostFunctionOp`'s `auth` vector will also require a
`SorobanAuthorizationEntry` with `credentials` that match the address in
`CreateContractArgs` used to derive the contractID (if the preimage is
`CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ASSET`, then no auth is required).`rootInvocation`
should be set to a `SorobanAuthorizedInvocation` where `function` is of type
`SOROBAN_AUTHORIZED_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT_HOST_FN`.
`function.createContractHostFn` should be set to the `CreateContractArgs` used
under the `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT` host function mentioned above.

The executable and identifier arguments are normally independent of each other
with an exception: identifiers that are built from
`CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ASSET` may only be used in conjunction with built-in
token contract source. This handles the special case of instantiating token
contracts corresponding to the classic Stellar assets (see more details in
[CAP-0046-06](./CAP-0046-06.md)).

The host builds the actual contract identifier by computing SHA-256 of the
`HashIDPreimage` corresponding to the `contractIDPreimage`. If the contract
identifier already exists, the operation fails.

If the identifier is new, the host will create a new Persistent
`ContractDataEntry` from [CAP-0046-05](./CAP-0046-05.md) with a
`SCV_LEDGER_KEY_CONTRACT_INSTANCE` key value. The value of the entry is
`ScContractInstance` that either refers to the Wasm code entry or to a built-in
contract (according to the value of the `executable` field in `CreateContractArgs`).

### Instantiating a contract from a contract

Factory contracts are quite popular already on other networks, so this CAP adds
functionality to support them. 

The following host functions are provided to instantiate contracts and upload Wasm:

```rust
// Uploads the Wasm. Returns the SHA-256 hash of the Wasm code.
fn upload_wasm(wasm: Bytes) -> Bytes

// Creates a Wasm instance using the deployer, SHA-256 hash of the Wasm, and a user specified salt.
// Returns the Address of the newly created contract.
fn create_contract(deployer: Address, wasm_hash: Bytes, salt:Bytes) -> Address

// Creates a Stellar Asset Contract for the XDR serialized asset passed in. Returns the Address
// for the newly created contract.
fn create_asset_contract(serialized_asset: Bytes) -> Address
```

The contractIDs for the contracts created with `create_contract` and
`create_asset_contract` are derived from `CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ADDRESS` and
`CONTRACT_ID_PREIMAGE_FROM_ASSET` respectively.

Similar to how contract creation through `HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_CREATE_CONTRACT`
requires authorization mentioned
[above](#instantiating-contracts-using-invokehostfunctionop), invoking the
`create_contract` host function requires authorization as well.

### Updating a contracts code

We also provide a host function that allows contract instances to update the
Wasm executable by first uploading the new code, and then calling
`update_current_contract_wasm` with the hash of the newly uploaded Wasm.The
update happens only after the current contract invocation has successfully
finished, so this can be safely called in the middle of a function.

```rust
// Updated the current contracts Wasm executable.
fn update_current_contract_wasm(wasm_hash: Bytes)
```

### Invoking a contract using `InvokeHostFunctionOp`
Contracts can be invoked via `InvokeHostFunctionOp` with
`HOST_FUNCTION_TYPE_INVOKE_CONTRACT` host function type.

The function accepts `InvokeContractArgs` struct that consists of the `contractAddress`, `functionName` and the `args` array.

The `auth` vector must be properly filled with the required credentials and the correct invocation details. Refer to [Soroban Authorization Framework](./cap-0046-11.md) for details.

If the invocation is successful, the return value `ScVal` along with `ContractEvent`s will be 
used to construct a `InvokeHostFunctionSuccessPreImage`, from which the hash is computed and 
returned in the `InvokeHostFunctionResult`. 

If the invocation fails, the `InvokeHostFunctionResult` will contain the proper error code 
indicating the failure reason.

The return value as well as all events (`ContractEvent`s and `DiagnosticEvent`s) will be included in the `TransactionMeta`, see [cap-0046-08](./cap-0046-08.md#specification) for details.

### Invoking a contract from a contract
[CAP-0046-03](./CAP-0046-03.md#call-host-functions-mod-d) specifies the host
functions that can be used for cross-contract invocations.

The `auth` vector must be properly filled with the required credentials and the correct invocation details. Refer to [Soroban Authorization Framework](./cap-0046-11.md) for details.

### Extend and restore contract

Both the contract instance and the contract code entry are persistent ledger entries which have finite, pre-specified TTLs.

We provide two additional operations `ExtendFootprintTTLOp` and `RestoreFootprintOp` for extending TTL and restoring entries.

See [State Archival Interface Cap](./cap-0046-12.md) for more details on archival semantics and operations for extending and restoring entries.

## Design Rationale

### There are no built in controls for contracts

Controls like pausing invocation or mutability for all or a subset of a contract
should be put into a contract itself. Leaving it to the contract writer is a
much more general solution than baking it into the protocol. The downside is
this is more error prone and will take more space since the same logic will be
implemented multiple times.

### `ContractDataEntry` has no owner associated with it

The entity that creates the `ContractDataEntry` that contains the contract code
is not tied to it in any way. This allows for contract management and
authorization to be handled in the contract using whichever custom mechanism
the contract creator chooses.

### `ContractCodeEntry` has no owner associated with it

Contract source code entries with the Wasm code don't have any ownership. Anyone
can upload contract sources to the ledger and then anyone can use them. This
encourages sharing the contract code and allows contracts that use it to be
sure that their implementation can't unexpectedly change.

### Contracts cannot be deleted, and can only be updated through the update_current_contract_wasm host function

The contract code reference is stored in a `ContractDataEntry`, but the host
functions in [CAP-0046-05](./CAP-0046-05#host-function-additions) to set,
update, or delete `ContractDataEntry` should trap if they are used on contract
code.

### Malicious contracts

The validators do not have a mechanism to ban specific contracts. Any kind of
targeted banning mechanism can be worked around quite easily by creating new
accounts and contracts.

### Maximum Wasm contract code size is configurable

The maximum contract size will be set during the protocol upgrade, and can be
updated by the validators. This allows to adjust the contract sizes depending
on the demand and network load requirements.

### ContractIDs are deterministic

Pulling contractIDs from `LedgerHeader.idPool` would be easier but it would make
parallelizing contract creation more difficult in the future. It's also more
difficult to determine what the contractID will be since the id pool would be
used by offers and other contracts. This CAP uses a `Hash` instead as the
contractID. 

With this CAP we provide several ways of building the contractID preimages that
can be reproduced off-chain and then used to address the contracts that may or
may not exist (for example, some general contracts like tokens or AMMs).

## Security Concerns

The security concerns from CAP-0046
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#security-concerns)
apply here as well.
