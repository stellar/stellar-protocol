## Simple Summary

Allow future extensibility of transaction types by making
`TransactionEnvelope` contain a union.

## Abstract

`TransactionEnvelope` now contains a union for the transaction type.
For binary compatibility, legacy transactions are now of type
`Transaction0` and can have an Ed25519 account ID only.

## Motivation

Right now, it will be very difficult to upgrade the `Transaction` type
in a backwards compatible way.  However, until we add a new account
type, we can take advantage of the fact that all `Transaction`
structures, when marshaled, start with a 0-valued 32-bit integer (part
of the `AccountID` which can only be a `PublicKey` or type
`PUBLIC_KEY_TYPE_ED25519`).  We make `TransactionEnvelope` contain a
union, and when the discriminant is 0, we have it contain a new type
`Transaction0` which is basically a `Transaction` with the
`PUBLIC_KEY_TYPE_ED25519` stripped off the beginning and the key type
hard-coded to Ed25519.

## Specification

We need only two changes.  `EnvelopeType` conveniently didn't have a
0, so we now allocate that for legacy transaction envelopes.  We then
add a union inside `TransactionEnvelope`.  Note that
`TransactionSignaturePayload` already had a union, so we don't need to
change it.  In particularly, we *don't* add a case for
`ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0` because we don't want there to be multiple ways to
compute a transaction ID.

We expect implementations to provide a helper function for converting
a `Transaction0` into a `Transaction`, as doing so is necessary for
computing the transaction ID.

~~~~ {.c}
enum EnvelopeType
{
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0 = 0,  // new
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCP = 1,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX = 2,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_AUTH = 3
};

struct Transaction0
{
    uint256 sourceAccountEd25519;  // was: AccountID sourceAccount;
    uint32 fee;
    SequenceNumber seqNum;
    TimeBounds* timeBounds;
    Memo memo;
    Operation operations<100>;
    union switch (int v) {
    case 0:
        void;
    } ext;
};

/* A TransactionEnvelope wraps a transaction with signatures. */
union TransactionEnvelope switch (EnvelopeType type) {
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0:
    struct {
        Transaction0 tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v0;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
    struct {
        Transaction tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v1;
};

## Rationale

There have been a number of proposals to change the transaction
format, or add different types of transaction.  We have also discussed
new `AccountID` types.  Though we haven't decided on which proposals
to adopt, changing the transaction format will become much harder if
we do so after adopting a new `AccountID` type, so we might as well
make this union change now.

## Backwards Compatibility

The changes are backwards compatible with legacy binary transactions.
The new code will be able to read old transactions, but old code
cannot read the new `TransactionEnvelope` type.  Hence, a phased
deployment makes sense.

## Example

Imagine we want to add a new `feeSource` field to transactions.  We
can simply introduce a new type `Transaction4` that contains this
extra field, then:

~~~~ {.c}
enum EnvelopeType
{
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0 = 0,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCP = 1,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX = 2,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_AUTH = 3,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX4 = 4  // new
};

struct TransactionSignaturePayload
{
    Hash networkId;
    union switch (EnvelopeType type)
    {
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
        Transaction tx;
        /* All other values of type are invalid */
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX4:
        Transaction4 tx4;
    }
    taggedTransaction;
};

/* A TransactionEnvelope wraps a transaction with signatures. */
union TransactionEnvelope switch (EnvelopeType type) {
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0:
    struct {
        Transaction0 tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v0;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
    struct {
        Transaction tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v1;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX4:
    struct {
        Transaction4 tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v4;
};
