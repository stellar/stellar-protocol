## Simple Summary

This proposal adds a new signer type that simplifies the signing process that
multiple parties must use in some contracts, such as payment channels, by
allowing all parties to share a batch of transactions for signing and
guaranteeing that if one transaction is signed, authorized, and submitted that
information is revealed that allows all other transactions in the batch to be
authorized.

## Working Group

This protocol change was authored by Leigh McCulloch, with input from the
consulted individuals mentioned at the top of this document.

## Motivation

[CAP-21] adds transaction precondition primitives that make it possible for
multi-party contracts, such as payment channels, to be implemented where a
relative time delay must occur between two transactions that have been mutually
agreed by all parties to the contract.

Signing a batch of transactions in contracts that have a time delay as specified
in [CAP-21] requires participants to exchange signatures for each transaction
across multiple-steps, exchanging the signatures for the transactions in reverse
order that they can be executed.

A party must not share their signature for an earlier transaction before
receiving all signatures for latter transactions otherwise another party may be
able to submit that earlier transaction and lock the contract by refusing to
authorize a latter transaction.

In the payment channel designs identified in the design rationale of [CAP-21]
this requires participants to exchange signatures across at least three
messages. This coordination increases implementation complexity. This complexity
increases significantly for payment channel implementations that are
asynchronous or payment channels where receiving participants are allowed to
fall behind confirming payments from a sending participant.

Making it safe for parties of a contract to exchange all signatures for a batch
of transactions in a single message without risk that only a subset of the
transactions could be authorized simplifies payment channel implementations.

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
create highly usable products

### Semantics

This proposal introduces one new type of signer, the ed25519 signed payload
signer, that is defined as a variable length opaque payload with a maximum size
of 32 bytes and an ed25519 public key. A signature for the signer is the result
of signing the payload with the private key that the public key is derived.

The ed25519 signed payload signer is usable everywhere existing signers may be
used, including in `extraSigners<1>` added in [CAP-21].

#### Signature

The signature of a ed25519 signed payload signer is the raw ed25519 signature of
the signer's payload using the private key that derives the signer's ed25519
public key.

Unlike other signatures in the Stellar protocol, the payload is not combined
with the network ID or hashed before passing it to the ed25519 signing
algorithm.

To represent another Stellar transaction as the the payload field of a Ed25519
signed payload signer, you must first place the transaction in a
`TransactionSignaturePayload` and hash that. The resulting signature will be a
ed25519 signature of the other Stellar transaction that could be attached to the
other transaction.

#### Signature Hint

The signature hint of an ed25519 signed payload signer is the last 4 bytes of
the ed25519 public key XORed with last 4 bytes of the payload. If the payload
has a length less than 4 bytes, then 1 to 4 zero bytes are appended to the
payload such that it has a length of 4 bytes, for calculating the hint.

#### Transaction Envelopes

This proposal makes no structural changes to transaction envelopes other than
the signature of an ed25519 signed payload signer may be included in the list of
decorated signatures.

#### Signature Checking

Signature checking is changed to include verifying that any ed25519 signed
payload signer's have matching signatures.

Ed25519 signed payload signer signatures are verified by performing ed25519
signature verification using the signature, the payload from the signer, and the
ed25519 public key from the signer.

## Design Rationale

This proposal provides a primitive that makes it possible to construct a batch
of transactions where all transactions can be authorized and submitted if the
first transaction is authorized and submitted.

This proposal makes this possible when the signer is used with the
`extraSigners` precondition introduced in [CAP-21], and does so without
introducing any new state to be stored on the ledger, allowing the signing
dependency to exist without creating ledger entries.

While it is possible to achieve a similar effect of this proposal with the
existing protocol by using the preauth transaction signer, use of that signer
requires creating a new ledger entry which is impractical in contracts with
multiple iterations.

The maximum size of the batch of transactions is three, limited to being one
more than the maximum number of `extraSigners` specified in [CAP-21], currently
two, and can be increased past three if the maximum size of `extraSigners` is
changed.

### Payment Channels

In the payment channel designs specified in [CAP-21] this proposal simplifies
the requirements on when participants may exchange signatures for transactions.

The following paragraph in CAP-21:

>To update the payment channel state, the parties 1) increment i, 2)
>sign and exchange a closing transaction C_i, and finally 3) sign and
>exchange a declaration transaction D_i.

May be changed to:

>To update the payment channel state, the parties 1) increment i, 2)
>sign and exchange a closing transaction C_i and declaration
>transaction D_i.

This changes the number of messages the parties must send to each other to 
update the payment channel, reducing the number from three to two. It reduces 
the number of messages down to one for any the payment channel implementation 
where the receiving party of a payment update is the beneficiary.

Three messages using CAP-21:
```
+---+        +---+
| A |        | B |
+---+        +---+
  |            |
  | C_i        |
  |----------->|
  |            |
  |   C_i, D_i |
  |<-----------|
  |            |
  | D_i        |
  |----------->|
  |            |
```

Simplified two message process using CAP-21 and CAP-40:
```
+---+        +---+
| A |        | B |
+---+        +---+
  |            |
  | C_i, D_i   |
  |----------->|
  |            |
  |   C_i, D_i |
  |<-----------|
  |            |
```

Simplified one message process using CAP-21 and CAP-40 where B is the only 
beneficiary of the update, supporting queue-like processing of payments:
```
+---+        +---+
| A |        | B |
+---+        +---+
  |            |
  | C_i, D_i   |
  |----------->|
  |            |
```

This simplified exchange would be implemented by requiring the sender of a
payment to include in D_i the `extraSigners` precondition with an ed25519 signed
payload signer where the payload is the transaction hash of C_i and the ed25519
public key is the public key of the receiving participant that must sign D_i and
C_i.

The effect of this change is the receiving participant must sign the transaction
hash of C_i to authorize D_i, embedding their signature for C_i into D_i. If the
receiving participant nefariously authorizes and submits D_i without sharing a
signature for C_i, the sender who is watching the network may see D_i be
submitted, extract the signature for C_i from the signatures on D_i, attach the
signature to C_i, and submit C_i.

### Other Uses

This new signer is likely to have other applications in scenarios similar to
where HASH_X signers are currently used, except that the data revealed would not
only be a hash shared by multiple transactions across multiple chains, but could
be a signature for a transaction on another chain, or a siganture for any other
use. However, this has limited use to only signatures of ed25519 keys as
specified.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

### Backwards Incompatibilities

This proposal is backwards compatible.

### Resource Utilization

No substantial changes to resource utilization.

The size of signatures, and therefore transactions, remain the same.

The effort to verify the signature is equivalent to the effort to verify an
ed25519 signature.

The size of signers stored in the ledger would be twice the size, at 64 bytes,
for ed25519 signed payload signers compared to 32 bytes for all other signers.
