 ## Security Concerns

 If a transaction requires the signature of a Signed Payload Signer and a signer
 signs it without understanding the preimage of the payload, the signer could be
 authorizing another Stellar transaction if the payload is a Stellar transaciton
 hash, or the signer could be authorizing some other operation on another network
 or application. People and applications should never sign a hash that they do
 not completely understand the consequences of signing, in all the contexts that
 their key provides authentication or authorization. People and applications
 should never sign a transaction they do not completely understand. There are
 many cases where signing a transaction not completely understood can pose a
 security concern for the signer because the signer could be authorizing
 something they would not approve of if they did understand the transaction. This
 proposal introduces a new case with the Signed Payload Signer.

 ## Implementation
