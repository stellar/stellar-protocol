## Simple Summary
This CAP proposes an update to `TransactionMeta` along with new host functions
to allow for contracts to write data to the meta that can be consumed by
downstream systems.

## Motivation
Contract writers will need a way to emit information about what their specific
contracts are doing. Downstream consumers of these new messages can also push
these to subscribers, allowing users to listen to specific messages.

### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:
* The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to create highly usable products

## Abstract
This CAP provides host functions for contracts to write events that will be put
into `TransactionMeta`. It also provides a way to cryptographically verify the events.

## Specification

### Contract Events
We introduced a `TransactionMetaV3`, which has an optional
`SorobanTransactionMeta` struct that should be set for Soroban transactions.
This contains a `events` vector of `ContractEvent`, which will contain the
events emitted by the host and contract.

### Cryptographic verification

`TransactionMeta` is not hashed into the ledger, which is an issue because the
events can't be cryptographically verified, and tests that replay historical
transactions will not catch instances where the events emitted have changed. To
fix this issue, `InvokeHostFunctionOp` returns the SHA-256 hash of
`InvokeHostFunctionSuccessPreImage`, which contains the SCVal return value of
the top level contract call, and the vector of events emitted. This makes the
events part of the protocol. 


### Diagnostic events
The host can also emit diagnostic events, which are not part of the protocol and
do not count towards metering and fees. These events are in a separate
`diagnosticEvents` vector in `SorobanTransactionMeta` with `ContractEventType`
`DIAGNOSTIC`. To be able to order diagnostic and non-diagnostic events,
`diagnosticEvents` will also contain all of the protocol events in the order
they were emitted. 

#### Host function
The `contract_event` host function specified in [CAP-0046-03](./CAP-0046-03.md#context-host-functions)
can be used to create events in contracts.

### XDR Changes

See the XDR diffs in the Soroban overview CAP, specifically those covering
changes to transaction meta and results, result sets, history entries, and
contract events.


## Design Rationale

### Different event types
Each event host function uses a different type. This gives downstream users
another fields to query off of. In addition to that, events from `system_event`
are also special in that they can only be used by the host functions, allowing
users to see "system" level events as opposed to ones generated by contracts.
For example, this can be used when contracts are created to emit the hash of the
created contract.

### Limits
There are no limits on individual events, but the total size of all events
emitted in a transaction. The maximum combined events size will be
introduced as `txMaxContractEventsSizeBytes` in the
`ConfigSettingContractEventsV0` `ConfigSettingEntry`(see
[CAP-0046-09](./cap-0046-09.md) for details on config entries).
`txMaxContractEventsSizeBytes` will be `10000` initially, and the minimum the
setting can be set to is `0`.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

### Backwards Incompatibilities
Downstream systems will need to be able to parse `TransactionMetaV3` for all
meta information.

### Resource Utilization
The events can make `TransactionMeta` larger by at most `txMaxContractEventsSizeBytes`.

## Security Concerns
The security concerns from [CAP-0051]
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0051.md#security-concerns)
apply here as well.

## Test Cases
TBD

## Implementation
TBD. See [rs-stellar-contract-env](https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-contract-env) and stellar-coreâ€™s repo (branch to be added) for the prototype implementation.
