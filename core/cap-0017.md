## Simple Summary
This proposal makes specifying and implementing the protocol easier by simplifying the semantics of
`LedgerEntry.lastModifiedLedgerSeq`.

## Abstract
It is currently possible for `LedgerEntry.lastModifiedLedgerSeq` to be updated by an operation even
if that operation did not make any modifications to the underlying data of that `LedgerEntry`. This
document proposes changing the semantics of `lastModifiedLedgerSeq` to be updated by an operation
if and only if the underlying data of that `LedgerEntry` has changed.

## Motivation
The main benefit of this proposal is that implementing the protocol would be simpler. The current
behavior forces implementers to carefully manage whether `lastModifiedLedgerSeq` should or should
not be updated in any given circumstance. The only reliable way for an implementer to determine
when `lastModifiedLedgerSeq` should be updated in the current protocol version is by referring to
an existing implementation. This proposal would unambiguously specify when `lastModifiedLedgerSeq`
should and should not be updated.

For example, using `AllowTrust` to authorize a trustline that is already authorized will update the
`lastModifiedLedgerSeq` of the trustline without making any other modifications. In contrast, a
tentative winner of `Inflation` that ends up winning nothing (due to, for example, having excessive
native asset liabilities) is unchanged and does not receive an updated `lastModifiedLedgerSeq`.

## Specification
The value of `lastModifiedLedgerSeq` should be updated by an operation if and only if the net
effect of that operation includes updating the underlying data of a `LedgerEntry`. Specifically, if
`leBefore` and `leAfter` are the `LedgerEntry` (excluding `lastModifiedLedgerSeq`) before and after
the operation has been applied, respectively, then `lastModifiedLedgerSeq` should be updated to
`LedgerHeader.ledgerSeq` if and only if `leBefore != leAfter`.

## Rationale
This proposal is to be applied at the operation level as it guarantees that if the net effect of
any operation in a transaction set includes updating the underlying data of a `LedgerEntry` then
the value of `lastModifiedLedgerSeq` will be updated. This behavior is desirable from an
implementation perspective because it allows each operation to correctly determine whether
`lastModifiedLedgerSeq` should be updated without any knowledge of whether the `LedgerEntry` has
been or will be modified by other operations in the same transaction set.

## Backwards Compatibility
Downstream systems which rely on `lastModifiedLedgerSeq` could be effected as the semantics of that
field will change.

## Test Cases
None yet.

## Implementation
No implementation yet.
