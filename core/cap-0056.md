## Simple Summary
This CAP proposes an update to `TransactionMeta` along with new host functions to allow for contracts to log messages that can be consumed by downstream systems.

## Motivation
Contract writers will need a way to emit information about what their specific contracts are doing. Downstream consumers of these new messages can also push these to subscribers, allowing users to listen to specific messages.

### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:
* The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to create highly usable products

## Abstract
This CAP provides host functions for contracts to log messages that will be put
into `TransactionMeta`. It provides a way to cryptographically verify the
contents of `TransactionMeta`, and also moves `TransactionResult` into the meta
so they stop taking space in the archives.

## Specification

### Contract Logs
This CAP makes a change to `TransactionMeta` and `TransactionResult` that will allow
a user to cryptographically verify anything in `TransactionMetaV3`.
`TransactionMetaV3` will store separate SHA256 hashes for ledger entry changes and
contract logs, and the hash of those hashes will be stored in `TransactionResultPairV2`.

How can this be used? The `LedgerHeader` contains the hash of the
`TransactionResultSetV2`, so the user will first gather all results from the desired
ledger, hash them, and verify that the hash matches what's in the `LedgerHeader`.
With `TransactionResultSetV2` verified, the user can then find the `TransactionMetaV3`
for the transaction they're interested in, hash just contract logs, combine
that hash with the other hashes in `TransactionMetaV3` and then verify it against
the hash stored in `TransactionResultPairV2`.

#### Host functions
```rust
/// Will save val to a list that will be returned to core so the logs can be
/// put into TransactionMetaV3.logs with type ContractLogType::CONTRACT_INFO.
func $log(param $val i64) (result i64)

/// Same as $log above but will use ContractLogType::LOG_ON_ERROR instead,
/// and the logs will only show up in TransactionMetaV3.logs if the contract call fails.
func $log_on_error(param $val i64) (result i64)

/// Internal host function. Same as $log but will use ContractLogType::SYSTEM instead
/// TODO: Should this only log on error?
func $system_log(param $val i64) (result i64)
```

#### Stop storing TransactionResults in archives
This CAP also removes the `TransactionResult` from the archives by using
`TransactionHistoryResultEntryV2`. Instead, the `TransactionResult` will be
stored in `TransactionMetaV3`, while the hash of `TransactionResult` will be
stored in `TransactionMetaV3::hashes`. With this change, the archives will take less
space, but it does mean that the results will need to be be pulled from the
meta. Cryptographic verification would work just like contract logs describe
above, except you would match against the `TransactionResult` hash stored in
`TransactionMetaV3::hashes`.

`LedgerHeader::txSetResultHash` will also be updated to store the hash of
`TransactionResultSetV2`.

TODO: Does this work with InnerTransactionResultPair?

## Design Rationale

### TransactionResult in TransactionMeta
By removing the `TransactionResult` from the archives, the archives will take
less space going forward. The results will still be available in thr meta, so
there is no functionality lost here.

### TransactionMeta hashes
This CAP allows for the cryptographic verification of `TransactionMetaV3` by
including the SHA256 hash of the `hashes` field in `TransactionResultPairV2`.
This allows the user to verify the authenticity of any of the subcomponents of
`TransactionMetaV3`. The components are hashed separately so the user only needs
to hash the components they care about, and assume the other component hashes
are authentic. If any of the component hashes are incorrect, the verification
will fail. 

### Different log types
Each log host function uses a different log type. This gives downstream users
another fields to query off of. In addition to that, logs from `log_on_error`
are only emitted to the meta if the contract traps, which will make failures
easy to debug. `system_log` is also special in that it can only be used by the
host functions, allowing users to see "system" level logs as opposed to ones
generated by contracts. 

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

### Backwards Incompatibilities
Any downstream system consume `TransactionResult` will need to pull this information from the `TransactionMeta` instead.

### Resource Utilization
TBD

## Security Concerns
The security concerns from [CAP-0051]
(https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0051.md#security-concerns)
apply here as well.

## Test Cases
TBD

## Implementation
TBD. See [rs-stellar-contract-env](https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-contract-env) and stellar-core’s repo (branch to be added) for the prototype implementation.
