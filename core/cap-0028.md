CAP: 0028
Title: Clear pre-auth transaction signer on failed transactions
Author: Siddharth Suresh
Status: Draft
Created: 2019-10-10
Discussion: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/495
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary
Pre-auth signers are only removed from the source account if signature verification on the transaction succeeds. The signer is left on the account otherwise. This proposal will remove the signer from the source account as long as the sequence number has been consumed, even if signature verification fails.

## Motivation
If signature verification for a pre-auth transaction fails, the pre-auth signer needs to be manually removed using the Set Options operation. If the sequence number for the failed transaction has been consumed, the pre-auth signer can never be used again, so there's no reason to keep it around.

CAP-0015 (Fee-Bump Transactions) also introduces behavior that can make it harder to clean up the obsolete pre-auth signers. If the outer fee bump transaction has an invalid signature, the inner transaction will still need to be applied. The pre-auth signer will not be removed due to the outer transaction failing, but the inner transaction can return `txSUCCESS`, so the account owner won't know to remove the signer.

### Goals Alignment
The Stellar Network should facilitate simplicity and interoperability with other protocols and networks.

## Abstract
If the sequence number for a transaction has been consumed on transaction application, but the signature verification fails, we will clean up the pre-auth signers. To do this correctly, we will also check the signatures of the operation source accounts, which will identify the rest of the pre-auth signers to remove. Once the pre-auth signers for the transaction and operations are checked, they can be removed.

## Specification

### High level steps

- On Transaction application
    1. Sequence number is valid
    2. Transaction signature verification fails
    3. Process sequence number
    4. Check operation source account signatures
    5. Remove all used pre-auth signers


### Implementation details

Operation signatures will be checked and `removeUsedOneTimeSignerKeys` will be called in `TransactionFrame::apply` if `commonValid` returns `ValidationType::kInvalidUpdateSeqNum`.

```c++
auto cv = commonValid(signatureChecker, ltxTx, 0, true);
if (cv >= ValidationType::kInvalidUpdateSeqNum)
{
    processSeqNum(ltxTx);
    if (ltxTx.loadHeader().current().ledgerVersion >= NEXT_LEDGER_VERSION 
        && cv == ValidationType::kInvalidUpdateSeqNum)
    {
        for (auto& op : mOperations)
        {
            op->checkSignature(signatureChecker, ltxTx, false, false);
        }
        removeUsedOneTimeSignerKeys(signatureChecker, ltxTx);
    }
}

auto signaturesValid = cv >= (ValidationType::kInvalidPostAuth) &&
                        processSignatures(signatureChecker, ltxTx);
```

If `cv` returns a higher value, then we default to the current behavior where `processSignatures` calls `removeUsedOneTimeSignerKeys` since the signature verification for the operations may depend on the one time signer keys.

### OperationFrame::checkSignature change
Something to note with this implementation is that `OperationFrame::checkSignature` will need to be modified. Each operation is given a reference to an `OperationResult`, which lives in an array in `TransactionResult`. When the transaction signature verification fails, `TransactionResult` is set to an error code(`txBAD_AUTH`), which results in the destruction of the underlying `OperationResult` array. The operations are still holding on to a reference to the now deleted `OperationResult`. `checkSignature` will try to modify this `OperationResult` if there is an issue with the signature. To avoid undefined behavior, a new flag will be passed into `checkSignature` that will determine if we should check the signature or not. The prototype will look like this `bool checkSignature(SignatureChecker& signatureChecker, AbstractLedgerTxn& ltx, bool forApply, bool setResult = true)`.

## Design Rationale
The proposed solution is simple and maintains backwards compatibility.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
None

## Security Concerns
There are no security concerns here, as this is a small change that removes a signer from a source account.

## Test Cases
