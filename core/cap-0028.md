CAP: 0028
Title: Clear pre-auth transaction signer on failed transactions
Author: Siddharth Suresh
Status: Draft
Created: 2019-10-10
Discussion: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/495
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary
Pre-auth signers are only removed from the source account if signature verification on the transaction succeeds. The signer is left on the account otherwise. This proposal will remove the signer from the source account as long as the sequence number has been consumed, even if signature verification fails.

## Motivation
If signature verification for a pre-auth transaction fails, the pre-auth signer needs to be manually removed using the Set Options operation. If the sequence number for the failed transaction has been consumed, the pre-auth signer can never be used again, so there's no reason to keep it around.

CAP-0015 (Fee-Bump Transactions) also introduces behavior that can make it harder to clean up the obsolete pre-auth signers. If the outer fee bump transaction has an invalid signature, the inner transaction will still need to be applied. The pre-auth signer will not be removed due to the outer transaction failing, but the inner transaction can return `txSUCCESS`, so the account owner won't know to remove the signer.

### Goals Alignment
The Stellar Network should facilitate simplicity and interoperability with other protocols and networks.

## Abstract
This proposal will add a `removeUsedOneTimeSignerKeys` call after `processSeqNum` if signature validation fails.

## Specification
`removeUsedOneTimeSignerKeys` will be called in `TransactionFrame::apply` if `commonValid` returns `ValidationType::kInvalidUpdateSeqNum`.

```c++
auto cv = commonValid(signatureChecker, ltxTx, 0, true);
if (cv >= ValidationType::kInvalidUpdateSeqNum)
{
    processSeqNum(ltxTx);
    if (ltxTx.loadHeader().current().ledgerVersion >= NEXT_LEDGER_VERSION 
        && cv == ValidationType::kInvalidUpdateSeqNum)
    {
        removeUsedOneTimeSignerKeys(signatureChecker, ltxTx);
    }
}

auto signaturesValid = cv >= (ValidationType::kInvalidPostAuth) &&
                        processSignatures(signatureChecker, ltxTx);
```

If `cv` returns a higher value, then we default to the current behavior where `processSignatures` calls `removeUsedOneTimeSignerKeys` since the signature verification for the operations may depend on the one time signer keys.

## Design Rationale
The proposed solution is simple and maintains backwards compatibilty.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
None

## Security Concerns
There are no security concerns here, as this is a small change that removes a signer from a source account.

## Test Cases
None yet

## Implementation
None yet
