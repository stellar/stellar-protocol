CAP: 0028
Title: Clear pre-auth transaction signer on failed transactions

Protocol version: TBD

## Simple Summary
Pre-auth signers are only removed from the source account if signature verification on the transaction succeeds. The signer is left on the account otherwise. This proposal will remove the signer from the source account as long as the sequence number has been consumed, even if signature verification fails.

## Motivation
If the sequence number check or signature verification for a pre-auth transaction fails, the pre-auth signer needs to be manually removed using the Set Options operation. If the sequence number for the failed transaction has been consumed, the pre-auth signer can never be used again, so there's no reason to keep it around.

CAP-0015 (Fee-Bump Transactions) also introduces behavior that can make it harder to clean up the obsolete pre-auth signers. If the outer fee bump transaction has an invalid signature, the inner transaction will still need to be applied. The pre-auth signer will not be removed due to the outer transaction failing, but the inner transaction can return `txSUCCESS`, so the account owner won't know to remove the signer.

### Goals Alignment
The Stellar Network should facilitate simplicity and interoperability with other protocols and networks.

## Abstract
- There are two new scenarios where we will remove the pre-auth signer from the transaction and operation source accounts -
    1. Sequence number check fails
    2. Signature verification fails

## Specification
This proposal will add functionality to remove a pre-auth signer even if the signer has not been checked yet. A method will be added to `TransactionFrame` that will check every transaction and operation source account for the pre-auth signer, and remove it if found. This method will be called if the sequence number or signature verification fails.

## Design Rationale
The proposed solution is simple and maintains backwards compatibility.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
None

## Security Concerns
There are no security concerns here, as this is a small change that removes a signer from a source account.

## Test Cases
None yet

## Implementation
