## Simple Summary
Automated market makers provide a simple way to provide liquidity and exchange
assets.

## Working Group
This proposal was initially authored by Jonathan Jove based on the results of
numerous discussions. The working group includes the author of a similar
proposal (OrbitLens), people with knowledge of market making (Nikhil Saraf and
Phil Meng), and a maintainer of Horizon and its SDKs (Tamir Sen).

## Motivation
Projects such as Uniswap have shown that automated market makers are effective
at providing easy-to-access liquidity at scale. The simplicity and
non-interactivity of liquidity pools can attract large amounts of capital and
enable high volumes of trading. We believe adding automated market makers to
Stellar will improve overall liquidity on the network.

### Goals Alignment
This proposal is aligned with several Stellar Network Goals, among them:

- The Stellar Network should run at scale and at low cost to all participants
of the network
- The Stellar Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via
exchange of assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments
between assets in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.
- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
create highly usable products.

## Abstract
This proposal introduces automated market makers to the Stellar network.
`LiquidityPoolEntry` is introduced as a new type of `LedgerEntry` which stores
the state of a liquidity pool. New operations, `LiquidityPoolDepositOp` and
`LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp`, are introduced to enable adding and removing
liquidity from liquidity pools. Because providing liquidity to a liquidity pool
yields pool shares, `TrustLineEntry` is modified to store pool shares and
`ChangeTrustOp` is modified to allow interacting with those trust lines. Pool
shares are not transferable. `PathPaymentStrictSendOp` and
`PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` are modified to act as an opaque interface to
exchanging assets with the order book and liquidity pools.

## Specification

### XDR changes
This patch of XDR changes is based on the XDR files in commit (`0af79475974609c524b26d2bd683a1033a8d5ff1`) of stellar-core.

### Semantics

#### LiquidityPoolDepositOp
`LiquidityPoolDepositOp` is the only way for an account to deposit funds into a
liquidity pool.

`LiquidityPoolDepositOp lpdo` is invalid if

- `lpdo.amountA <= 0`
- `lpdo.amountB <= 0`
- `lpdo.minAmountA <= 0`
- `lpdo.minAmountB <= 0`

The process of applying `LiquidityPoolDepositOp lpdo` with source `sourceAccount`
is
```
tlPool = loadTrustLine(sourceAccount, lpdo.liquidityPoolID)
if !exists(tlPool)
    Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_NO_TRUST

// tlPool exists so lp exists too
lp = loadLiquidityPool(lpdo.liquidityPoolID)
cp = lp.constantProduct()

tlA = loadTrustLine(sourceAccount, cp.assetA)
tlB = loadTrustLine(sourceAccount, cp.assetB)
if !exists(tlA) || !exists(tlB)
    Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_NO_TRUST
if !authorized(tlA) || !authorized(tlB) || !authorized(tlPool)
    Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_NOT_AUTHORIZED

if cp.totalPoolShares != 0
    reserveA = lp.constantProduct().reserveA
    reserveB = lp.constantProduct().reserveB

    amountA = 0
    amountB = 0
    if reserveB * cp.amountA <= reserveA * cp.amountB
        amountA = cp.amountA
        amountB = reserveB * amountA / reserveA // TODO: Rounding?
    else
        amountB = cp.amountB
        amountA = reserveA * amountB / reserveB // TODO: Rounding?
    if amountA < cp.minAmountA || amountB < cp.minAmountB
        Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_BAD_PRICE

    if availableBalance(tlA) < amountA || availableBalance(tlB) < amountB
        Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_UNDERFUNDED

    total = lp.constantProduct().totalPoolShares
    sharesA = total * amountA / reserveA // TODO: Rounding?
    sharesB = total * amountB / reserveB // TODO: Rounding?
    amountPoolShares = min(sharesA, sharesB)
    if availableLimit(tlPool) < amountPoolShares
        Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_LINE_FULL

    tlA.balance -= amountA
    lp.constantProduct().reserveA += amountA
    tlB.balance -= amountB
    lp.constantProduct().reserveB += amountB
    tlPool.balance += amountPoolShares
    lp.constantProduct().totalPoolShares += amountPoolShares
else
    if availableBalance(tlA) < cp.amountA || availableBalance(tlB) < cp.amountB
        Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_UNDERFUNDED

    amountPoolShares = sqrt(cp.amountA * cp.amountB) // TODO: Rounding?
    if availableLimit(tlPool) < amountPoolShares
        Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_LINE_FULL

    tlA.balance -= amountA
    tlB.balance -= amountB
    tlPool.balance += amountPoolShares

Succeed with LIQUIDITY_POOL_DEPOSIT_SUCCESS
```

#### LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp
`LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp` is the only way for an account to withdraw funds from
a liquidity pool.

`LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp lpwo` is invalid if

- `lpwo.amount <= 0`

The process of applying `LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp lpwo` with source `sourceAccount`
is
```
tlPool = loadTrustLine(sourceAccount, lpwo.liquidityPoolID)
if !exists(tlPool)
    Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_WITHDRAW_NO_TRUST

// tlPool exists so lp exists too
lp = loadLiquidityPool(lpwo.liquidityPoolID)
cp = lp.constantProduct()

tlA = loadTrustLine(sourceAccount, cp.assetA)
tlB = loadTrustLine(sourceAccount, cp.assetB)
if !exists(tlA) || !exists(tlB)
    Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_WITHDRAW_NO_TRUST
if !authorized(tlA) || !authorized(tlB) || !authorized(tlPool)
    Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_WITHDRAW_NOT_AUTHORIZED

reserveA = lp.constantProduct().reserveA
reserveB = lp.constantProduct().reserveB
total = lp.constantProduct().totalPoolShares

amount = lp.constantProduct().amount
if availableBalance(tlPool) < amount
    Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_WITHDRAW_UNDERFUNDED

amountA = amount / totalPoolShares * reserveA // TODO: Rounding?
amountB = amount / totalPoolShares * reserveB // TODO: Rounding?

if availableLimit(tlA) < amountA || availableLimit(tlB) < amountB
    Fail with LIQUIDITY_POOL_WITHDRAW_LINE_FULL

tlA.balance += amountA
lp.constantProduct().reserveA -= amountA
tlB.balance += amountB
lp.constantProduct().reserveB -= amountB
tlPool.balance -= available
lp.constantProduct().totalPoolShares -= available

Succeed with LIQUIDITY_POOL_WITHDRAW_SUCCESS
```

#### ChangeTrustOp
The validity conditions for `ChangeTrustOp` are unchanged if
`line.type() != ASSET_TYPE_POOL_SHARE`. `ChangeTrustOp` is additionally invalid
if `line.type() == ASSET_TYPE_POOL_SHARE` and

- `line.liquidityPool().constantProduct().assetA >= line.liquidityPool().constantProduct().assetB`
- `line.liquidityPool().constantProduct().fee != 12884902` (this very closely
approximates 0.3%)

The behavior of `ChangeTrustOp` is unchanged if
`line.type() != ASSET_TYPE_POOL_SHARE`. If
`line.type() == ASSET_TYPE_POOL_SHARE` then

- The referenced trust line `tl` has
`tl.asset.liquidityPoolID() == SHA256(line.liquidityPool())`
- If a trust line is created, then `AUTHORIZED_FLAG` is set (other flags may
also be set according to existing logic).
- If no liquidity pool with `liquidityPoolID == SHA256(line.liquidityPool())`
exists, then that liquidity pool is created.
- If a trust line is created, then `numTrustLines` is incremented on the
corresponding liquidity pool. If a trust line is erased, then `numTrustLines` is
decremented on the corresponding liquidity pool.
- If `numTrustLines` on the corresponding liquidity pool becomes 0, then that
liquidity pool is erased.

#### PathPaymentStrictSendOp and PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp
For each step in the path, the exchange will be routed to the order book or
liquidity pool that yields the best price for the entire exchange. The behavior
is changed such that

- the price of the exchange is computed for each liquidity pool, recording the
best price but discarding any changes to the ledger
- the price of the exchange is computed for the order book
- if the price of exchange through the order book is better than the best price
for the liquidity pools, then that result is returned
- otherwise, any changes to the ledger are discarded and the exchange is
performed against the liquidity pool that yielded the best price

Exchanging with a liquidity pool depends on the invariants enforced. This
proposal only introduces a constant product liquidity pool. The invariant for
such a liquidity pool is `(X + x - Fx) (Y - y) >= XY` where

- `X` and `Y` are the initial reserves of the liquidity pool
- `F` is the fee charged by the liquidity pool
- `x` is the amount received by the liquidity pool
- `y` is the amount disbursed by the liquidity pool

This can be rearranged to yield `y = Y - XY / (X + x - Fx)` which simplifies to
```
y = Y [1 - X / (X + x - Fx)]
  = Y [(X + x - Fx) - X] / (X + x - Fx)
  = (1-F)Yx / (X + x - Fx)
```
In this proposal, `F = 0.003`.

### Erasing the Liquidity Pool
Unused liquidity pools are erased automatically. An unused liquidity pool is
characterized by the property that no account has a trust line for the
corresponding pool shares. The implementation of `LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp` must
guarantee that the liquidity pool has no reserves if no account owns shares in
the liquidity pool, in order to avoid destroying assets.

### No LiquidityPoolEntry Reserve
This proposal does not require a reserve for a `LiquidityPoolEntry`. This is
justified by the fact that a `LiquidityPoolEntry` cannot exist without the
existence of a `TrustLineEntry` which can hold the pool share. The
`TrustLineEntry` does require a reserve. This choice provides the cleanest user
experience for `LiquidityPoolDepositOp` because any account can create the
`LiquidityPoolEntry`, avoiding a race condition where accounts cannot predict
whether they will need a reserve.

An alternative approach is to treat a `LiquidityPoolEntry` like a
`ClaimableBalanceEntry`, so it is always sponsored. This would still allow the
account that creates a pool to be merged if it can find another account to
assume the sponsorship.

### Liquidity Pools Support Arbitrary Asset Pairs
Some implementations of liquidity pools, such as Uniswap V1, enforced the
requirement that one of the constituent assets was fixed. More recent
implementations, such as Uniswap V2, have generally removed this constraint.

This proposal allows complete flexibility in the constituent assets of a
liquidity pool. We believe that this enables liquidity to be provided in the
manner that is most efficient. For example, providing liquidity between two
stablecoins with the same underlying can be relatively low risk (assuming both
are creditable). But if instead liquidity had to be provided against some fixed
third asset, then the liquidity provider would be subject to impermanent loss in
both liquidity pools.

### Price Bounds for LiquidityPoolDepositOp
Fix assets X and Y. Suppose that `p > 0` is the value of Y in terms of X. A
portfolio consisting of `x` of X and `y` of Y has value `x + py` in terms of X.

Fix a real-valued differentiable function `f` of two real-valued variables such
that for all `p > 0` the system of equations
```
0 = f(x,y)
df/dy = p df/dx
```
has a unique solution with `x,y > 0` and `x' + py' >= x + py` for all `(x',y')`
satisfying `x',y' > 0` and `f(x',y') = 0` that are sufficiently near to
`(x,y)`. Consider a liquidity pool where the reserves `x` of X and `y` of `Y`
are constrained to satisfy `f(x,y) = 0`. Then the value of the reserves can be
minimized by the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let `z` be a Lagrange
multiplier and define the Lagrangian `L(x,y,z) = x + py - z f(x,y)`. This
yields the system of equations
```
0 = dL/dx = 1 - z df/dx
0 = dL/dy = p - z df/dy
0 = dL/dz = -f(x,y) .
```
`z` can be eliminated by combining the first two equations, which produces
`df/dy = p df/dx`. Following from the definition of `f`, there exist unique
`x,y > 0` that satisfy these equations. Furthermore, `(x,y)` is a local minima
subject to the constraints.

This result, while abstract, has important consequences. Depositing to the
liquidity pool is equivalent to purchasing a fraction of the pool in exchange
for an equal fraction of the assets in reserve. As demonstrated above,
depositors get the best price when they deposit at the fair price of the pool.
But an attacker can temporarily move the price of the pool, thereby capturing a
profit while depositors make a loss. We conclude that any liquidity pool
governed by the assumptions above must have bounds on the deposit price to
prevent a vulnerability.

It is easy to see that the constant product invariant satisfies the above
conditions. Let `f(x,y) = xy - k` for some `k > 0`. For all `p > 0` the system
of equations
```
0 = xy - k
x = py
```
has the unique solution `y = sqrt(k/p), x = sqrt(kp)` where `x,y > 0`. Now note
that for any `(x',y')` satisfying `x',y' > 0` and `f(x',y') = 0`, the AM-GM
inequality implies
```
x' + py' = x' + kp/x' >= 2 sqrt(kp) = x + py .
```

### No Price Bounds for LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp
The corrolary to the above results "Price Bounds for LiquidityPoolDepositOp"
is that an attacker cannot profit at the expense of a withdrawer, because moving
the pool from its fair price actually makes the pool shares more valuable. It
follows that no price bounds are required, because there is no attack. If one
wants price bounds on a withdrawal for some other reason, then this can be
achieved by first depositing an infinitesimal amount in the same transaction.

### LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp Specifies a Withdrawal Amount
In some jurisdictions, every operation on a blockchain is considered a taxable
event. This means that the process of withdrawing all funds in order to deposit
a new amount could have extremely adverse tax consequences. Allowing arbitrary
withdrawal amounts avoids this issue with little extra complexity.

### Store Pool Shares in Trust Lines
This proposal stores pool shares in trust lines, without allowing pool shares
to be used in any operation except `LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp` and `ChangeTrust`.
This means that pool shares already have any associated data that could be
necessary to make them transferable or control authorization, but we do not
enable these features in this proposal.

### Pool Shares are not Transferable
There are good reasons that pool shares should be transferable, most notably
that this would facilitate using them as collateral in lending. Stellar has very
limited support for lending, so this reason is not sufficient to justify the
effort of supporting transferability at this point. This proposal is designed
such that transferability could easily be added in a future protocol version.

### Trust Lines for Pool Shares are Authorized
`ChangeTrustOp` creates trust lines for pool shares with the `AUTHORIZED_FLAG`
set. Pool shares aren't transferable, so the authorization state can only be
used by `LiquidityPoolDepositOp` and `LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp` which will not
work if either of the constituent trust lines are unauthorized. Therefore this
produces reasonable authorization semantics analogous to shared control by the
issuers of the constituent assets.

### Pool Shares are not Subject to Clawback
This proposal does not permit clawback of pool shares. If the issuer for one of
the constituent assets executed a clawback, this may infringe on the rights and
obligations of the issuer of the other constituent asset. This complicates the
clawback model and raises questions about what it means to execute a clawback of
a pool share.

One possible model would be that clawback is equivalent to withdrawing from the
liquidity pool, then executing clawback on the withdrawn asset that the issuer
controls. Although this has behavior that seems reasonable, it creates new
technical problems. What happens if the account does not currently have a trust
line for the other underlying asset? What hapepns if the account does have a
trust line for the underlying asset but it has insufficient limit or is not
authorized?

### No Interleaved Execution
This proposal uses `PathPaymentStrictSendOp` and `PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` as
a opaque interfaces to exchange on the Stellar network. These operations are
referred to as opaque interfaces because there is no way to specify how you want
the exchange to execute. This approach is favorable because it requires no
changes to clients that depend on exchange.

Because this is an opaque interface, the only thing we should absolutely require
is that adding liquidity pools as an execution option should never make the
exchange price worse. This is a weak requirement. Specifically it is much weaker
than requiring that exchange produces the best price.

The primary reason not to require that exchange produces the best price is ease
of implementation. Requiring that exchange always produces the best price
automatically implies execution that is interleaved between the order book and
any liquidity pools. In other words, the exchange might cross some offers and
also exchange trade with liquidity pools. Compare against the simpler
implementation where an exchange will execute against either

- the order book alone (this is exactly what happens in protocol 16)
- one specific liquidity pool alone

depending on which produces the better price. This price is not guaranteed to be
the best possible price, but by construction it cannot be worse than executing
against the order book alone.

#### Residual Arbitrage Opportunities
There are a variety of objections to this approach, but none of them justifies
the additional complexity of interleaved execution. It is claimed that
interleaved execution guarantees that there will be no arbitrage opportunities
after exchange. This is true when considering only the order book and liquidity
pools involving the same assets, but false otherwise. If there are linear
combinations of assets which are effectively risk-free, then exchange will
still generate arbitrage opportunities even if interleaved execution is used.

A concrete example where this could occur is if there were two highly creditable
issuers of USD. Let's call the assets USD1 and USD2. Suppose a large exchange
occurs from USD1 to EUR. With interleaved execution, there are no arbitrage
opportunities between the order book and liquidity pools for USD1/EUR. But it
could still be possible to sell USD1 for EUR, then buy USD2 for EUR at a profit.
If there is a USD1/USD2 market then the arbitrageur may be able to settle their
position instantly. Otherwise, the arbitrageur may wait until the opposite
arbitrage opportunity arises to unwind their position.

There is also the reality that if the price of a liquidity pool has moved enough
to generate an arbitrage opportunity with the order book or another liquidity
pool, then it has probably moved enough to generate an arbitrage opportunity
with some centralized exchange.

#### Computing the Best Price
It is relatively easy to compute the best price if there is an order book and a
single constant product liquidity pool. In this setting, the interleaved
execution algorithm dictates that exchange should always execute where the best
marginal price is available. It is clear that if the best order and the
liquidity pool have the same marginal price, then the exchange should execute
on the order book because the marginal price is constant _while executing that
order_ whereas the marginal price for a constant product liquidity pools always
gets worse.

With more than one liquidity pool, computing the best price becomes increasingly
difficult. The cause of this difficulty is that once two liquidity pools reach
the same marginal price, subsequent exchanges must be executed against those
pools simultaneously. We will consider an example with `N > 1` liquidity pools
but no order book. This is a lower bound on the complexity if the order book is
included, because it is always possible that the order book is empty.

Let `g[j](x)` be the amount of Y received after selling x of X to pool `j`.
Finding the best price when selling z of X is equivalent to solving the
constrained optimization problem
```
Max g[1](x[1]) + ... + g[N](x[N])
Subject to
    x[1] >= 0
    ...
    x[N] >= 0
    z = x[1] + ... + x[N]
```
This can be solved by applying the
[Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions).
The Lagrangian is
```
L(x[1],...,x[N],a[1],...,a[N],b) = g[1](x[1]) + ... + g[N](x[N]) + a[1] x[1] ... + a[N] x[N] - b(x[1] + ... + x[N] - z)
```
with corresponding first order conditions
```
0  = dL/dx[1]      = g'[1](x[1]) + a[1] - b  (stationarity)
...
0  = dL/dx[N]      = g'[N](x[N]) + a[N] - b  (stationarity)
0 <= dL/da[1]      = x[1]                    (primal feasibility)
...
0 <= dL/da[N]      = x[N]                    (primal feasibility)
0  = dL/db         = z - x[1] - ... - x[N]   (primal feasibility)
0 <= a[1]          = a[1]                    (dual feasibility)
...
0 <= a[N]          = a[N]                    (dual feasibility)
0  = a[1] dL/da[1] = a[1] x[1]               (complementary slackness)
...
0  = a[N] dL/da[N] = a[N] x[N]               (complementary slackness)
```

For concreteness, suppose that all of the liquidity pools are constant product.
Pool `j` has fee `F[j]` and reserves `X[j], Y[j]`.  In this case
```
g[j](x[j])  = (1-F[j]) Y[j] x[j] / (X[j] + x[j] - F[j] x[j])
g'[j](x[j]) = (1-F[j]) X[j] Y[j] / (X[j] + x[j] - F[j] x[j])^2
```
The stationarity constraints can be expressed as
```
(b - a[1]) / g'[1](x[1]) = 1
...
(b - a[N]) / g'[N](x[N]) = 1
```
which makes the problem a multivariate inequality constrained system of
polynomial equations. In general, solving such systems is extremely hard. The
general case of this problem is NP-hard. I emphasize that I _have not_ shown
that systems constrained to this particular form are NP-hard. But the burden of
proof to show that they are not NP-hard rests on those who want to pursue best
pricing.

In reality, it is not necessarily true that all of the liquidity pools will be
constant product. Even if the problem is tractable with constant product
liquidity pools, the risk is that future developments will lead to problems
that are NP-hard.

### CreatePassiveOfferOp, ManageBuyOfferOp, and ManageSellOfferOp Unchanged
This proposal does not change the behavior of `CreatePassiveOfferOp`,
`ManageBuyOfferOp`, and `ManageSellOfferOp`. This is a consequence of not
enforcing best pricing and interleaved execution. The Stellar protocol does not
permit the order book to be crossed, so any order that is modified by these
operations must execute against the order book.

A pleasant side-effect of this is that these operations are to the order book
as `LiquidityPoolDepositOp` and `LiquidityPoolWithdrawOp` are to the liquidity
pools, in the sense that they are the only way to change liquidity provided to
those venues.

### ClaimAtom
In order to enable `PathPaymentStrictSendOp` and `PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` to
emit accurate information about exchanges with liquidity pools, we converted
`ClaimOfferAtom` into a union named `ClaimAtom`. But `ClaimAtom` is not required
for `CreatePassiveOfferOp`, `ManageBuyOfferOp`, and `ManageSellOfferOp` because
they cannot execute against liquidity pools. To avoid unnecessary disruption, we
do not make the analagous change for these operations.

### No Minimum Deposit Time
Other proposals include a minimum time that funds must be deposited in a
liquidity pool before they can be withdrawn. The argument is that this will help
ensure stability of liquidity, avoiding fluctuations as volume moves between
different pairs.

This proposal does not include a minimum deposit time. The primary argument is
that liquidity fluctuations are the direct manifestation of liquidity providers
trying to deploy their capital in the most profitable way. But this means that
capital is being deployed where there is the most demand for liquidity and the
least supply of it, as that is where liquidity pools generate the most profit.
This is exactly the kind of behavior that we want to encourage on the Stellar
network.

There is a second argument for not including a minimum deposit time. A minimum
deposit time is friction, as it inhibits people from using their money the way
that they want to. Modern payment networks, like Stellar, should be trying to
remove friction rather than create it.

### Future Work: Support Fees Other than 0.3%
This proposal fixes the constant product market maker fee at 0.3%. But we expect
future protocol versions to take advantage of the extensibility which has been
built into this proposal to support other fees. Such changes should be
relatively easy to implement.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

### Backwards Incompatibilities
This proposal introduces one backwards incompatibility. Clients that depend on
`PathPaymentStrictSendOp` and `PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` executing against the
order book will be broken. There are two ways a client could depend on this

- Expecting to receive a certain price
- Expecting to execute certain orders

In both cases, the client must control the state of the order book in order to
realize these expectations. But if a client used to control the state of the
order book, then they would also control the state of liquidity pools according
to this proposal. Therefore, the risk of this backwards incompatibility is
minimal.

### Resource Utilization
This proposal should have a minor effect on resource utilization. Converting
`PathPaymentStrictSendOp` and `PathPaymentStrictReceiveOp` into opaque
interfaces for exchange will slightly increase the constant factors associated
with these operations but will not effect the asymptotic complexity.
