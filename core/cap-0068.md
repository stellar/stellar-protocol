## Simple Summary

This is a CAP describing a new Soroban host function for getting the executable corresponding to an `Address`.

## Working Group

As described in the preamble section.

## Motivation

There is currently no way to get the executable for an arbitrary address, so it's not possible to distinguish between Wasm and built-in contracts (currently, the only such contract is Stellar Asset contract) and not possible to get the specific Wasm hash corresponding to the contract. This information serves multiple different use cases, such as:
- Custom accounts will be able to provide authorization policies based on the executables, for example, only allow a few vetted token implementations to be used.
- Contracts will be able to generically distinguish between SAC instances and custom tokens on-chain. Currently possible for a custom token to impersonate metadata of any SAC, including the one for the 'native' token (XLM) and there is no on-chain way to distinguish between these. This is especially relevant for the bridge protocols that provide a capability to wrap Stellar tokens on different chains and need to create metadata for the wrapped tokens.
- In general contracts will be able to 'pin' the exact implementations of their dependencies. While this is not necessary (or even desired) for majority of the protocols, there are use cases where pinning increases security. For example, this allows custom accounts to give restricted authorization privileges to the separate 'session' contracts without worrying about the change in the implementation of these contracts.


### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

  - The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects
    to create highly usable products

## Abstract

A new host functions that returns an executable for the provided `Address` is added to the Soroban host.

## Specification

### New host function

The diff is based on commit `822727b37b7ef2eea1fc0bafc558820dc450c67e` of `rs-soroban-env`.

         },
```

### Semantics

`get_address_executable` host function will be added. This function returns the value of type `Option<AddressExecutable>` where `AddressExecutable` is defined as follows:

```rust
#[contracttype]
enum AddressExecutable {
    Wasm(BytesN<32>),
    StellarAsset,
    Account,
}
```

The semantics of the return value are as follows:

- If there is no ledger entry for the provided address in the storage `None` (i.e. `Val::VOID`) is returned
    - 'No ledger entry' means no respective `AccountEntry` for the account (`ScAddress::Account`) addresses and no respective `ContractData` (with `ScVal::LedgerKeyContractInstance` key) entry for contract addresses (`ScAddress::Contract`)
- If there is a ledger entry, then it is converted to the `AddressExecutable`:
    - Contracts are represented depending on their executable type:
        - Wasm contracts are represented by `AddressExecutable::Wasm` with the corresponding SHA-256 hash of the underlying Wasm code
        - Stellar asset contract instances are represented by `AddressExecutable::StellarAsset`
    - Accounts are represented as `AddressExecutable::Account`

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

The proposed host function will use the standard mechanism for protocol-gating the host functions and will become available in protocol 23. Before protocol 23 it will be impossible to upload Wasm that uses the new functions.

### Backwards Incompatibilities

This CAP does not introduce any backward incompatibilities.

### Resource Utilization

The new host function will have the appropriate metering. No new cost types need to be introduced, as the operations can lean on the existing metering primitives.

## Security Concerns

`get_address_executable` gives contracts access to data that has previously been unavailable. However, there is no  obvious way to abuse this data, as it does not reveal the internal state of the contract.

## Test Cases

## Implementation
