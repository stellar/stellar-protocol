## Simple Summary

Implement a minimal way to interact with smart contracts.

## Motivation

Many contracts need to determine when an agent is authorized to take a
particular action. When the agent is external (such as a person or legal
entity), a contract typically makes such a determination by verifying one or
more digital signatures. When the agent is itself a contract, a contract
typically assumes that the contract can take any action permitted by its code.

In Ethereum, many contracts unify this determination by relying on `msg.sender`
(for more information on this approach, see CAP-0050). Unifying this
determination means providing some notion of authorization in the protocol
itself. Unfortunately, there are many reasonable authorization mechanisms with
various advantages and disadvantages in the context of Stellar. In order to
avoid choosing between these reasonable mechanisms and the consequence costs
and risks associated with making a suboptimal choice, this proposal supports
the minimal set of functionality that contracts would rely on to implement their
own authorization.

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products

## Abstract

This proposal introduces `InvokeHostFunctionOp` which permit interacting with
contracts. Furthermore, new host functions to facilitate authorization are
introduced. To facilitate account based authorization, host functions are
introduced to read account thresholds and signers. To facilitate authorization
of contracts, the `get_invoking_contract` host function is introduced. The
proposal implies that contracts will rely heavily on presigned messages,
although this proposal does not recommend any standards for their safe usage.

## Specification

### XDR Changes

See the XDR diffs in the Soroban overview CAP, specifically those covering
new transaction operations to invoke host functions.

### Semantics

#### No Changes to Overlay or Transaction Queue

This proposal doesn't introduce any new transaction envelope types, so all
downstream concepts such as overlay messages and transaction queue work without
modification.

#### External Interaction with a Smart Contract

To interact with a contract, a user will submit a `TransactionEnvelope env`
with the following properties:

- `env.tx.seqNum = seqNum(env.tx.sourceAccount) + 1`
- `availableBalance(env.tx.sourceAccount) >= env.tx.fee`
- `env.tx.operations.len() == 1`
- `env.signatures` are valid signatures for signers of `env.tx.sourceAccount`
with total weight exceeding `lowThreshold(env.tx.sourceAccount)`

`op = env.tx.operations[0].body.invokeHostFunctionOp()` will have the following
properties:

- `op.function` is `HOST_FN_CALL`
- `op.parameters` is a vector containing
`(contractID: SCO_BINARY, symbol: SCO_BINARY, parameters: SCO_VECTOR)`
- `op.footprint` contains at least the data that will be read or written

Because the operation `sourceAccount` is ignored, we also require
`env.tx.operations[0].sourceAccount` is null.

#### Authorization

To check whether an agent is authorized to take a specified action, a contract
can use the following host functions

```rust
// Traps if the running contract was not called by a contract
// Returns the ContractID for the contract that called the running contract
fn get_invoking_contract() -> ContractID;

// Traps if acc doesn't exist
// Returns loadAccount(acc).thresholds[THRESHOLD_LOW]
fn get_low_threshold(acc: AccountID) -> u8;

// Traps if acc doesn't exist
// Returns loadAccount(acc).thresholds[THRESHOLD_MED]
fn get_medium_threshold(acc: AccountID) -> u8;

// Traps if acc doesn't exist
// Returns loadAccount(acc).thresholds[THRESHOLD_HIGH]
fn get_high_threshold(acc: AccountID) -> u8;

// Traps if acc doesn't exist
// Traps if key is not the master key for acc or a signer for acc
// Returns
//     - the master weight for acc if key is the master key for acc, or
//     - the signing weight for key
fn get_signer_weight(acc: AccountID, key: u256) -> u8;

// Traps if sig in not a signature for msg from key
fn verify_ed25519(msg: Vec<u8>, key: u256, sign: Vec<u8>);
```

While `verify_ed25519` can be implemented in a contract, there will be
significant performance improvements from including such a fundamental operation
as a host function.

#### Cross-Contract Calls

To make a cross-contract call, a contract can invoke the host function

```rust
// parameters must be a vector
fn call(contractID: ContractID, symbol: SCSymbol, parameters: SCVal) -> SCVal;
```

which loads `f = loadSymbol(contractID, symbol)` then invokes
`f(parameters[0], ..., parameters[n])` where `n` is the length of `parameters`.
Immediately after the contract begins execution, a call to `get_invoker()` will
return the `ContractID` for the calling contract.

## Design Rationale

This is the minimal possible design for interacting with smart contracts. The
only protocol primitive for authorization is `get_invoking_contract`, which must
be provided because contracts cannot sign for themselves.

### Avoiding Confused Deputy Problems

Relying on the decorated signatures of the transaction envelope for
authorization of the source account can cause confused deputy problems. For
example, a server might be given access to a private key in order to pay the
fee for user transactions. If a contract relied on those same signatures, then
a malicious user could trick the server by submitting a transaction that invokes
a contract in the name of the server's key. The server could then unknowingly
authorize a contract invocation when it meant to authorize the payment of fees.

To avoid this problem, contracts must not have access to the transaction source
account or decorated signatures. Given this restriction, it is always safe to
pay the fees for a contract invocation.

### Transaction Sequence Number Doesn't Provide Replay Prevention

Because the contract doesn't have access to the source account (see "Avoiding
Confused Deputy Problems"), the sequence number cannot be used to provide replay
prevention. For this reason, contracts are not given access to the transaction
sequence number.

### No Function To Check Account Signatures

Instead of providing a host function to check account signatures, we provide a
host function to get the weight of a signer. This is a more flexible interface
that allows contracts to filter or transform the signers.

## Examples

For brevity, the examples in this section do not include the network identifier
in presigned messages. In general, including the network identifier is
recommended to mitigate the risk of a message from one network being replayed on
another network.

### Simple Token Based on Single Ed25519 Key

First, we define the following identifier type:

```rust
enum Identifier {
    Account(u256),
    Contract(ContractID),
}
```

Next, we define the following functions for replay prevention and authorization:

```rust
// No signatures required (public access)
// Returns the current nonce of "addr"
fn nonce_of(addr: u256);

// Internal function
fn check(nonce: u256, params: Vec<u256>, key: u256, sig: Vec<u8>) {
    // Check that this is not a replay
    if nonce != nonce_of(key) {
        trap();
    }

    // Traps if sig is not a signature for msg from key
    let msg = sha256(nonce, params);
    verify_ed25519(msg, key, sig);

    // ... increment the nonce of key ...
}
```

We then define the following interface:

```rust
// No signature required (public access)
// Returns the amount "spender" can transfer from "from"
fn allowance_of(from: Identifier, spender: Identifier) -> u256;

// Define APPROVE_SEPARATOR =
//     sha256("approve(nonce: u256, from: u256, spender: Identifier, "
//            "amount: u256, sig: Vec<u8>)"),
// Calls check with
//     nonce = nonce
//     params = vec![APPROVE_SEPARATOR, spender, amount]
//     key = from
//     sig = sig
// Updates the amount "spender" can transfer from "from" to "amount"
fn approve(nonce: u256, from: u256, spender: Identifier, amount: u256, sig: Vec<u8>);

// Traps if not invoked by a contract (via get_invoking_contract)
// Updates the amount "spender" can transfer from get_invoking_contract() to "amount"
fn contract_approve(spender: Identifier, amount: u256);

// No signature required (public access)
// Returns the balance of "addr"
fn balance_of(addr: Identifier) -> u256;

// No signature required (public access)
// Returns the total supply of this token
fn total_supply() -> u256;

// Define TRANSFER_SEPARATOR =
//     sha256("transfer(nonce: u256, from: u256, to: Identifier, amount: u256, "
//            "sig: Vec<u8>)")
// Calls check with
//     nonce = nonce
//     params = vec![TRANSFER_SEPARATOR, to, amount]
//     key = from
//     sig = sig
// Transfers "amount" from "from" to "to"
// Returns true on success, false otherwise
fn transfer(nonce: u256, from: u256, to: Identifier, amount: u256, sig: Vec<u8>) -> bool;

// Traps if not invoked by a contract (via get_invoking_contract)
// Transfers "amount" from get_invoking_contract() to to"
// Returns true on success, false otherwise
fn contract_transfer(to: Identifier, amount: u256) -> bool;

// Define TRANSFER_FROM_SEPARATOR =
//     sha256("transfer_from(nonce: u256, spender: u256, from: Identifier,
//            "to: Identifier, amount: u256, sig: Vec<u8>)"),
// Calls check with
//     nonce = nonce
//     params = vec![TRANSFER_FROM_SEPARATOR, to, amount]
//     key = spender
//     sig = sig
// Transfers "amount" from "from" to "to", decreases allowance of "spender" for "from"
// Returns true on success, false otherwise
fn transfer_from(nonce: u256, spender: u256, from: Identifier, to: Identifier,
                 amount: u256, sig: Vec<u8>) -> bool;

// Traps if not invoked by a contract (via get_invoking_contract)
// Transfers "amount" from "from" to "to", decreases allowance of get_invoking_contract() for "from"
// Returns true on success, false otherwise
fn contract_transfer_from(from: Identifier, to: Identifier, amount: u256) -> bool;
```

The public access functions are exactly analogous to ERC-20. The `contract_*`
functions are exactly analogous to ERC-20 but can only be used by contracts.
The other functions are analogous to ERC-20 but have additional parameters to
specify a nonce (replay prevention), actor (identity), and signature
(authorization).

### Simple Token Based on Account Signatures

First, we define the following identifier type:

```rust
enum Identifier {
    Account(AccountID),
    Contract(ContractID),
}
```

Next, we define the following functions for replay prevention and authorization:

```rust
// No signatures required (public access)
// Returns the current nonce of "acc"
fn nonce_of(acc: AccountID);

// Internal function
fn check(nonce: u256, params: Vec<u256>, acc: AccountID, sigs: Vec<(u256, Vec<u8>)>) {
    // Check that this is not a replay
    if nonce != nonce_of(acc) {
        trap();
    }

    let msg = sha256(nonce, params);
    let mut weight = 0u32;
    for (key, sig) in sigs {
        // Traps if sig is not a signature for msg from key
        verify_ed25519(msg, key, sig);

        // Traps if key cannot sign for acc
        weight += get_signer_weight(acc, key);
    }

    // Traps if signatures have insufficient weight
    if weight < get_medium_threshold(acc) {
        trap();
    }

    // ... increment the nonce of acc ...
}
```

We then define the following interface:

```rust
// No signature required (public access)
// Returns the amount "spender" can transfer from "from"
fn allowance_of(from: Identifier, spender: Identifier) -> u256;

// Define APPROVE_SEPARATOR =
//     sha256("approve(nonce: u256, from: AccountID, spender: Identifier, "
//            "amount: u256, sigs: Vec<(u256, Vec<u8>)>)"),
// Calls check with
//     nonce = nonce
//     params = vec![APPROVE_SEPARATOR, spender, amount]
//     acc = acc
//     sigs = sigs
// Updates the amount "spender" can transfer from "from" to "amount"
fn approve(nonce: u256, from: AccountID, spender: Identifier, amount: u256,
           sigs: Vec<(u256, Vec<u8>)>);

// Traps if not invoked by a contract (via get_invoking_contract)
// Updates the amount "spender" can transfer from get_invoking_contract() to "amount"
fn contract_approve(spender: Identifier, amount: u256);

// No signature required (public access)
// Returns the balance of "addr"
fn balance_of(addr: Identifier) -> u256;

// No signature required (public access)
// Returns the total supply of this token
fn total_supply() -> u256;

// Define TRANSFER_SEPARATOR =
//     sha256("transfer(nonce: u256, from: AccountID, to: Identifier, "
//            "amount: u256, sigs: Vec<(u256, Vec<u8>)>) -> bool");
// Calls check with
//     nonce = nonce
//     params = vec![TRANSFER_SEPARATOR, to, amount]
//     acc = from
//     sig = sigs
// Transfers "amount" from "from" to "to"
// Returns true on success, false otherwise
fn transfer(nonce: u256, from: AccountID, to: Identifier, amount: u256,
            sigs: Vec<(u256, Vec<u8>)>) -> bool;

// Traps if not invoked by a contract (via get_invoking_contract)
// Transfers "amount" from get_invoking_contract() to to"
// Returns true on success, false otherwise
fn contract_transfer(to: Identifier, amount: u256) -> bool;

// Define TRANSFER_FROM_SEPARATOR =
//     sha256("transfer_from(nonce: u256, spender: AccountID, from: Identifier, "
//            "to: Identifier, amount: u256, sigs: Vec<(u256, Vec<u8>)>) -> bool");
// Calls check with
//     nonce = nonce
//     params = vec![TRANSFER_FROM_SEPARATOR, to, amount]
//     key = spender
//     sig = sig
// Transfers "amount" from "from" to "to", decreases allowance of "spender" for "from"
// Returns true on success, false otherwise
fn transfer_from(nonce: u256, spender: AccountID, from: Identifier, to: Identifier,
                 amount: u256, sigs: Vec<(u256, Vec<u8>)>) -> bool;

// Traps if not invoked by a contract (via get_invoking_contract)
// Transfers "amount" from "from" to "to", decreases allowance of get_invoking_contract() for "from"
// Returns true on success, false otherwise
fn contract_transfer_from(from: Identifier, to: Identifier, amount: u256) -> bool;
```
