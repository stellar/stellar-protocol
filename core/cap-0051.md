## Simple Summary
This CAP proposes a set of host functions — interface between the host environment running on the Stellar Core and the WebAssembly-based (WASM) virtual machine running smart contracts, as well as expands the host object repertoire on which those host functions operate. This CAP also lays out a framework for resource accounting and gas metering on the smart contracts. 

## Motivation
The Stellar Network currently supports a rich but fixed repertoire of transactions that are insufficiently flexible in adapting to new application needs. The smart contract subsystem aims to address this limitation by allowing developers to submit custom turing-complete code to run in the transaction-execution phase of the network. This CAP specifies the core building blocks of such a system. 

### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:
* The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to create highly usable products

## Abstract
This CAP specifies the signatures of host functions that serve as the host-VM interface, divided into logical modules. It then introduces new host objects, their XDR signature, and new semantics of their conversion and comparison. The selection criteria of the host functions and the framework of resource accounting are detailed in the Design Rationale.

## Specification
The entire suite of host functions are broken down into logical modules, each evolving around a specific area of functionality (e.g. map, vector, BigInt). 

The host functions, which define the interface between the host environment and the virtual machine (VM), are specified in [WebAssembly text format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) to preserve generality, since implementation of the host functions are supposed to be language agnostic.

There are a few properties and conventions that apply generally to all host functions, they are outlined below to avoid repeating on every function.

#### Exception safety
Execution of the host function should never cause an exception in the host environment. If the execution fails for any reason, the host will emit a trap to the VM to stop execution immediately and abort the underlying transaction. Here are a few general conditions resulting in a trap:
1. The guest runs out of gas. Resource accounting and gas fee calculation will be discussed later.
2. Trying to create new host objects when there’s no slots left. Total number of host objects cannot exceed `UINT32_MAX+1`.
3. A host object handle does not correspond to the intended host object type. 
4. Invalid reference to a host object is provided.

#### Parameter types and nomenclature
All parameters (input arguments and return value) are 64-bit integers, and they either represent a generic value or a specific subtype of host value (such as a number, a generic handle to a host object) or handle to a specific host object type. For the full definition of host value types, refer to [CAP-0046](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#host-value-type).  
For clarity, the input parameters are named by following rules to differentiate the value types:
- An `$obj` denotes a generic handle to a host object, this means “expect this argument to be handle to an host object, don’t care its type”.
- A handle to a specific host object type `xyz` is defined as `$obj_xyz`, e.g. `$obj_vec`. this means “expect this argument to be handle to an host object of type ‘xyz’, any other type would not work”.
- Multiple objects of the same type may have their names appended with `_a`, `_b` etc to differentiate.
- Any other names can be assumed to be a generic value, e.g. `idx`, `key`, `val`. 

#### Immutability
All host functions respect the immutability constraint on the host objects (see [CAP-0046](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#immutability)). Any function that mutates a host object (e.g. `vec_push`) will create a new host object and return its handle. 

With that, we now present the host functions. 
### General host functions
```
/// Takes the two object handles and performs deep comparison.
/// Returns:
///   -1    if a < b,
///   0     if a == b,
///   1     if a > b
func $obj_cmp (param $obj_a i64) (param $obj_b i64) (result i64)
```

### XDR changes
This CAP builds on top of CAP-0046 by expanding the repertoire of host object types. Thus the diff is made with CAP-0046 assuming it will be merged into stellar-core before this CAP finalizes. This section will be updated to observe any changes made to the CAP-0046 XDR set.

### New host object types
The following new host object types are introduced on top of [CAP-0046](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#host-object-types):
- Object type 6: an arbitrary precision big integer number (BigInt). Although there is no explicit numerical limit the BigInt, its size is bounded by the XDR binary length limit of 256000, which equates to numerical range from -256^256000 + 1 to 256^256000 - 1. Several operations on the BigInt also imposes numerical limits on the operand due to possible memory overflow:
1. The operand of the left and right shift operations (`bigint_shl` and `bigint_shr` cannot be negative and cannot exceed size of `u64`. 
2. The exponent in `bigint_pow` cannot be negative and cannot exceed size of `u64`.

- Object type 7: an XDR hash.
- Object type 8: an XDR public key.

Of which, type 7 and 8 are XDR types, which follow the same standard semantics of XDR objects described in CAP-0046 including comparison, validity and conversion. Additional semantics are listed below.

#### Comparison
- Public key / hash: if A and B are both public keys / hashes with different types, they are ordered by the type value. If A and B are of the same public key / hash types, they are ordered by the key / hash values. 
- BigInt: if A and B are both BigInts with different signs, they are ordered by the sign values. If A and B are of the same signs, they are ordered by their values -- (`sign`) `magnitude`.

#### Conversion for BigInt
The host object uses implementation-specific data structure to store the sign and magnitude of the BigInt. We intend to use leverage Rust's [num-bigint](https://docs.rs/num-bigint/latest/num_bigint/) crate, which internally stores the magnitude as a `vec<u64>`. However, the conversion rule described here should be easily generalizable to other implementations.

From XDR (`ScObject` with `type` case `SCO_BIGINT`) to a host object:

Construct the host object BigInt with sign consistent with the `sign` case of the `SCBigInt`. If `sign` is `SCNumSign::ZERO`, then BigInt's magnitude is left empty. Otherwise, decode the bytes stored in the `magnitude` field in big-endian (BE) into the BigInt's magnitude. For example with [num-bigint](https://docs.rs/num-bigint/latest/num_bigint/)'s implementation, the first `u64` element in the `vec` will be constructed by taking the last 8 bytes in the opaque array, reverse the order, shift each byte by `8 * index`, then compute the sum. Refer to [from_bytes_be](https://docs.rs/num-bigint/0.4.3/num_bigint/struct.BigInt.html#method.from_bytes_be) for implementation detail. 

From a host object to XDR:

Construct the `SCBigInt` with the correct `sign` case, consistent with the BigInt's sign. If the BigInt is zero, then it's done. Otherwise, encode the BigInt's magnitude in BE into bytes stored in the `magnitude` field. Refer to [to_bytes_be](https://docs.rs/num-bigint/latest/num_bigint/struct.BigInt.html#method.to_bytes_be) for implementation detail.

#### Conversion for other types
For other types, i.e. `SCO_HASH`, `SCO_PUBLIC_KEY`, conversion between XDR and host object is to simply move around the contained value unaltered. 


## Design Rationale
The WASM smart-contract system for the Stellar network is divided into the host context and the guest context, and the host functions define the interface between the host environment (running the host context) and the VM (running the guest code) via which guest code can interact with the compute resources and host objects. For the full definitions of the host and guest context, host environment, virtual machine, please refer to the “Components” section in [CAP-0046](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0046.md#components).
The guest-host split allows common smart contract operations and computational heavy-liftings to be off-loaded to the host side. This reduces guest code size and results in a variety of benefits outlined in CAP-0046. However on the flip side, this potentially increases the attack surface and maintenance burden for the host function developers. Therefore it is vital to be judicious on host function selection, and it needs to be based on a clear set of criteria. The criteria we choose for host functions in this phase of the project are:
- **Relevance**: the functions need to be relevant to a wide spectrum of smart contract applications. In particular, we would like to prioritize the expensive primitives that are common among smart contract operations. 
- **Determinism**: produces designed outcome deterministically, both in terms of function output and gas cost. They also must perform deterministically across future version upgrades. 
- **Efficiency**: must run within a reasonably limited resource restriction. Any smart contracts that run out of its resource limits will result in a trap. 
- **Easy to implement**: must be reasonably straightforward to implement. This is especially relevant for the first-version of the prototype.

### Additional functions/host objects may be included
The list of host functions presented above is by no means an exhaustive list of host functions that are officially determined. Rather It is to be interpreted as an initial set of recommendations based on the four criteria listed above, to serve as a starting point to be iterated on. Ultimately, the official list will be determined by the requirements and needs of the stellar ecosystem. For example, the cryptographic section currently only contains two functions which are the primitives (SHA256, ED25519) usd by the stellar core today. Ultimately it will be driven by the smart contract applications and the cryptographic primitives that are most vital to facilitating their development. 

Besides cryptographic operations, big rational numbers and string operations are two additional sections we may consider to include depending on feedback from the developer community. Additional host objects may be added accordingly as a consequence. 

### Resource accounting / Gas cost
This CAP cannot be complete without well-defined resource accounting metrics for each host function. Resource consumption needs to be accounted for on both guest and host sides. On the guest side, resource is measured by the instruction count on the WASM virtual machine as well as the size of the machine. On the host side, the resource count depends on a few main factors:
1. Computation cost is measured by the size of the input and the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm. E.g. insertion of a single element into an ordered map have complexity of `alpha x log(n)`, with `n` being the total size of the map. 
2. `alpha` is the empirical cost parameter that is determined by measuring and calibrating against various host object operations (e.g. multiplying BigNums) as well as existing ledger transactions (e.g. making a payment). They thus can change over time based on the ledger state and the global fee schedule. The exact schedule of these cost parameters is beyond the scope of this CAP.
3. The memory cost is measured by the size of the input objects, as well as intermediate and final objects created during the function call (since all operations are immutable).
4. The resource accounting must sufficiently account for data structure overhead. This is especially relevant if we have a large amount of small host objects (e.g. a vector of size 1), or deeply nested host objects (vector of vectors of maps…).

### Error handling — favor traps over errors
There are three main reasons for biasing error handling to generate traps in the host functions rather than returning errors to the guest code. 
1. Minimizes the amount of redundant error-handling guest code even on the non-error path, thus reducing cost. 
2. Trapping on the host in most error cases ensures errors are handled (by escalation to a transaction abort), whereas many functions that have "error code returns" can have those errors ignored, which makes contracts more likely to be buggy. 
3. There is no easy way to communicate a structured error value to the user (such as a `result` or `option`) type. We would wind up either allocating an object to wrap every result from every function or commit one bit in the host value to denote a `None` value (analogous to Rust’s `std::option`). Both of these approaches introduce more complexity and are error prone. 

There is also a flexibility cost to traps. Contract developers have no opportunity to write code that is allowed to fail. For this reason, it is a goal that host functions that trap should provide a way to preemptively determine if a trap would occur if called. For example, the `vec_get` function will trap if the index argument is greater than the length of the vector, but a contract developer can use the `vec_len` function to check if this would occur before calling `vec_get`.

### `SCStatus`-Returning Host Functions
`SCStatus` is an `SCVal` case designed for conveying function-calling status (such as error code) between the host and the guest. The `SCStatus` cases will be expanded to include additional types as well as concrete host function error codes in future iterations of this CAP. 

The only host functions that returns the `SCStatus` currently are `map_prev_key`, `map_next_key`, `map_first_key` and `map_last_key`, which return an `SCStatus` containing the error code corresponding to an "element not exist" error (the exact error code and type are TBD).

But what if a host function's return value **is** a `SCStatus`? E.g. calling `vec_get` on a vector object `vec<SCStatus>`. 

In order to disambiguate the two cases (host function returning an `SCStatus` to communicate a call status versus a host function returning a stored `SCStatus` value), we will disallow any storage of `SCStatus` in the host context. Thus a returned `SCStatus` can only be interpreted as a function call status. 

## Protocol Upgrade Transition
This CAP does not introduce any protocol changes.

### Backwards Incompatibilities
This CAP does not introduce any backwards incompatibility.

### Resource Utilization
By allowing smart contracts to invoke host functions operating on host objects, this CAP introduces significant change in resource utilization patterns that are discussed in Design Rationale, and will be further expanded before finalization. 

## Security Concerns
The security concerns are the same as what have been outlined in CAP-0046. By expanding the host object repertoire and introducing host functions that create and operate on host objects on-the-fly during runtime, we’ve expanded the surface where those concerns manifest. In particular, this CAP aims to address “the risk of mis-metering of guest-controlled resources and denial of service”, by detailing the exact metrics of resource accounting on both the guest and the host side. 

## Test Cases
TBD

## Implementation
TBD. See [rs-stellar-contract-env](https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-contract-env) and stellar-core’s repo (branch to be added) for the prototype implementation.
