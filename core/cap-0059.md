## Simple Summary
BLS12-381 is a pairing-friendly elliptic curve which enables a new suite of applications. This CAP proposes a set of new host functions providing access to BLS12-381 curve operations.

## Working Group

As described in the preamble section.

## Motivation
Pairing friendly elliptic curve operations are the backbone of many advanced Zero Knowledge (ZK) constructions, with a wide array of applications ranging from scaling to identity management.

BLS12-381 is one of the most well-known and widely adopted pairing friendly curves, due to its efficiency and 128-bit security. However, the curve operations are inherently computationally intensive, making them prohibitive to be implemented in a smart contract. Providing an efficient implementation for a well-chosen set of curve and field operations natively inside the Soroban host is crucial for unlocking zero knowledge functionality in smart contracts

### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

  - The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects
    to create highly usable products

## Abstract
11 new host functions are proposed for performing field and curve operations on BLS12-381. Definitions and the semantics of each new host function, as well as the associated new metering parameters, will be introduced and explained.

### Semantics

#### Field and groups

`fp` - field element in the base field. Encoding rule: big-endian encoding of the underlying unsigned 48-byte integer.

`fp2`- field element in the quadratic extension of the base prime field. Encoding rule: concatenation of the two encoded-components `c1` and `c0` i.e. `be_encode(c1) || be_encode(c0)`

`fp12` - field element in the 12-degree prime extension field. This is the output from the pairing operation. `fp12` is only used as intermediary and encoding is not needed.

`fr` - scalar. A scalar has maximum length of 32 bytes. `fr` is represented with an `U256Val`.

`G1` - group containing points over the base prime field that satisfy the curve equation, plus point at infinity. Encoding rule: concatenation of the two encoded-coordinates (uncompressed form), each being an `fp`, i.e. `be_encode(X) || be_encode(Y)`

`G2` - group containing points over the quadratic extension of the base prime field that satisfy the curve equation, plus the point at infinity. Encoding rule: concatenation of the two encoded-coordinates (uncompressed form), each following `fp2` encoding rule, i.e. `be_encode(X_c1) || be_encode(X_c0) || be_encode(Y_c1) || be_encode(Y_c0)`

#### New host functions introduced

Below is a detailed specification of every new host functions introduced, the new costs involved, as well as the new error conditions introduced. It is important to note that these functions exist in the larger context of the runtime, which has a set of restrains already in place and described in previous CAPs. Specification here only covers new behaviors (including costs and errors) unique to these functions.

#### Tweak to the budget charging formula
When a cost model is evaluated multiple times with the same input, an internal optimization is bulk charging. Consider the following linear model `Y = a + scaled_b * X`, where `X` and `Y` are model input and output, `a` is a regular constant, `scaled_b` is a scaled constant with extra bits of precision. The current sequence of computation 1. compute `m = scaled_b * X` 2. unscale the result `unscale(m)`, 3 add the unscaled output to `a`. 

In the current protocol, applying bulk model charging directly multiplies the iteration count `I` to the evaluated model output i.e. `I * Y`. In the new protocol, the iteration count is applied to individual term before computing the sum, i.e. `I * a + I * scaled_b * X`, this simple tweak helps increasing the budget bulk charge accuracy, by preserving precision during the intermediate computation of the linear term.

## Design Rationale

### Function list choice
The list of host functions follows closely what has been proposed in [eip-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537), and has been adopted by Ethereum, with many proven ZKP use cases. 

The proposed list includes two additional "hash to curve" functions which performs hashing arbitrary message to curve points: `bls12_381_hash_to_g1` and `bls12_381_hash_to_g2`, which follow the IETF hash-to-curve standard as specified in [rfc9380](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9380/).

#### `U256Val` for scalar
All field and group elements mentioned in the host functions are represented as `BytesObject`, with encoding rule specified in [fields and groups](#field-and-groups), except for the scalar element. Since the scalar can be up to 32-bytes, with same semantics as an unsigned integer, using `U256Val` is the natural choice. Extracting bytes in the correct format can be tricky and error prone, depending on the underlying implementation (for example it is common for field elements implementations to store the montgomery backend number for better computation efficiency, extracting the bytes require performing the reduction first). Using `U256Val` also takes advantage of the internal small value optimization which reduces storage space for small numbers, see [value type repertoire](cap-0046-01.md/#rationale-for-value-and-object-type-repertoires).

#### No plain "pairing" function
The multi-pairing-check function is provided in instead of a direct pairing function. This is also inline with the choice of eip-2537. 

Most applications requiring pairing also performs comparison of pairing results, such as BLS signature verification, or verification of zk-SNARKs. The pairing comparison `e(a, b) == e(c, d)` can be converted to a multi-pairing evaluation of `e(a, b) * e(-c, d) == 1`. The main benefit is cost saving, since final exponentiation (the most expensive part of pairing) only needs to be performed on the final result. Not providing the plain pairing function also simplifies the host interface, since it eliminates the need to serialize and return the pairing result in `fp12`, which is 576 bytes long, and prevents contract from unknowingly opting into the expensive pattern (in terms of both compute and storage).

### Choice of the cost types
The new metering [cost types](#new-metering-costtypes-introduced) broadly follow the selection criteria outlined in [cap-0046-10](cap-0046-10.md). The set is designed to efficiently represent distinct, non-overlapping units of computation, ensuring optimal separation of work components.

#### Encode/Decode
The only two cost types representing encoding/decoding are of the base field element `Bls12381EncodeFp` and `Bls12381DecodeFp`, since all field and group elements can be composed of the base elements. (En)Decoding `G1` is (en)decoding two `fp` separately, same for `fp2`. `G2` contains two `fp2`, that are (en)decoded separately. `fr` is also represented as a field element of a less order, thus (en)decoding work is strictly less than on an `fp` (and thus okay to use `fp` as an moderate overestimation for it).

Our encoding/decoding follows the original [spec](https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash/blob/6e0364cd42a2b3d2b958a54771ef51a8db79dd29/pairing/src/bls12_381/README.md).

#### Contract panic on error
While not particular to, or introduced by this proposal, it is important to point out that if any error occurs whiling calling a host function, the host will trap the guest VM, which terminates the execution of the guest contract. A host error can span a wide range of reasons, such as running out-of-budget or trying to access an invalid object reference, most of which aren't recoverable for the contract (the [`try_call`](cap-0046-03.md/#call-host-functions-mod-d) function allows calling a contract function in fallible ways, i.e. return `Void` on non-internal errors). This design is to ensure the integrity of the execution runtime (see [cap-0046-01](cap-0046-01.md/#interface) and [cap-0046-03](cap-0046-03.md/#error-handling) for details).

Therefore the new error conditions introduced in this proposal (see [New host functions introduced](#new-host-functions-introduced)) intend to make sure these are actual errors (not a legitimate `false` condition), or they are important for safeguarding the host's runtime integrity. (The [pairing function](#bls12_381_multi_pairing_check) for example does *not* error on a failed pairing check, it returns `true`/`false`).

There are only two types of new errors introduced: 1. Decoding errors and 2. input vector length errors. 

On the former, it is a crucial step and a standard practice to ensure all cryptographic inputs are properly formed and conforms to the specified standards. A malformed input is likely to be a mistake in the contract, or a malicious attempt at the underlying runtime (e.g. a DOS attempt to make runtime perform work without charging). (Note also the underlying library implementation most likely also performs all the checks and errors if they fail. We are just front loading them on the host as an extra safety measure, and to provide a better error code/message.) If there is an legitimate use case for badly-encoded input, those checks should also be easy to implement on the sdk/guest side.

On the latter, mismatched vector size, or a zero-sized vector input is most likely mistake in contract logic, and one that is easy to mitigate by including proper sdk/guest side checks.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition
The proposed host functions will become available protocol 22, i.e. with `"min_supported_protocol": 22` in the interface definition. For `protocol_version <= 21`, attempting to import any of these function definitions in the WASM will lead to a linking error during Vm instantiation time. 

### Backwards Incompatibilities
This CAP does not introduce any backward incompatibilities.

### Resource Utilization
The performance impact of the new host functions have been captured by the new `CostType` described above. The cpu and memory consumption need to be calibrated carefully on each new `CostType` to ensure that the cost of running BLS host functions are metered properly and subject to the network limits. Final calibration numbers are TBD.

## Security Concerns
The main security concerns include
- Logic correctness. The proposed set of functions cover a wide range of cryptographic operations, which rely on correctness of 3rd party implementations. Incorrect implementation or failure to cover certain corner case potentially be exploitable vulnerabilities. 
- Denial of service. Since the proposed operations are computationally intensive, failure to properly calibrate any part, or to properly account for an extra-expensive path, could lead to the actual computation time significantly exceeding the metered costs, thus potentially lead to denial of service.

## Test Cases
Besides thorough unit and integration tests that are standard to any protocol implementation, in addition, we will be adding external test vectors as reference, these include:
- [Ethereum BLS12-381 test vectors](https://github.com/ethereum/bls12-381-tests). This shall cover the 11 major host functions that overlap with Ethereum's precompile (eip-2537).
- Hashing to Elliptic Curves RFC provided test vectors for [BLS12-381 G1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9380#name-bls12-381-g1-2) and [BLS12-381 G2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9380#name-bls12-381-g2-2). These shall cover the two hash-to-curve functions we added.
