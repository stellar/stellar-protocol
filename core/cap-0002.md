## Simple Summary
Make signature verification behave the same way pre and post consensus
 in order to make smart contracts easier to author.

## Abstract

Perform signature verification (for each operation) before performing
any of the transaction side effects.

This may still allow certain transactions to invalidate future transactions
in the same transaction set, while allowing operations in a transaction to
safely manipulate signers.

## Motivation

Currently signatures are verified in two different ways:
* when building a transaction set for consensus, verification is done without
any of the operation side effects
* when applying transactions post consensus, each operation checks again for
signatures

The problem with this approach is that some operations may cause subsequent
operations in the same transaction to fail, making crafting pre-signed
transactions that manipulate multiple signers or weights very complicated
(or impossible) to implement in the context of multiple operations within
a transaction.

## Specification

Transaction's `doApply` will be modified to perform in order:
1. transaction level changes
    1. sequence number processing
    2. signature verification
        1. verify signatures for each operation
        2. removal of one time signatures
2. operations processing, for each operation: 
    1. validity checks (same as today except for the signature verification)
    2. side effects

## Rationale

This approach makes signature verification behave the same way than how sequence
numbers are now processed (in v10 of the protocol as per cap-0001).

Removal of one time signatures are done first in order to avoid introducing a
new concept of "post transaction side effects" that are not currently modeled
in the meta data.

Note that we *could* add this notion to protocol 10 as cap-001 has not been put
in production yet but the added complexity doesn't seem to be necessary.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change makes certain transaction succeed that are now failing.

There are probably no good use cases for those failures, so it is deemed safe.

## Test Cases
Transactions that should now succeed:

### change thresholds twice
```json

// transaction that changes A thresholds twice
envelope:
{
    tx:
    {
        source: A,
        operations:
        [
            [ op: setOptionsOp, weigths: [1,1,2,3] ],
            [ op: setOptionsOp, weigths: [1,1,2,3] ]
        ]
    },
    signatures: [A]
}
```

Failing right now with `opBAD_AUTH` for second operation.

### lower master weight twice
```json
// A with weigths=[10,1,5,10]

// transaction that lowers master weight twice
envelope:
{
    tx:
    {
        source: A,
        operations:
        [
            [ op: setOptionsOp, masterWeight : 9 ],
            [ op: setOptionsOp, masterWeight : 8 ]
        ]
    },
    signatures: [A]
}
```

Failing right now with `opBAD_AUTH` for second operation.

### remove signer and do something
```json
// A with signers: {key: B, weight: 1}; weigths=[1,2,2,2]
envelope:
{
    tx:
    {
        source: A,
        operations:
        [
            // deletes B from signers
            [ op: setOptionsOp, signer : {key:B, w:0} ],
            [ op: setOptionsOp, homeDomain : "stellar.org" ]
        ]
    },
    signatures: [A, B]
}
```

Failing right now with `opBAD_AUTH` for second operation.
