## Simple Summary
This CAP addresses the following authorization semantics requirements:
- An issuer should always be able to authorize a trustline regardless of any issuer flags.  
- An issuer should always be able to revoke a trustline for an asset that is set as revocable.

## Working Group

This protocol change was authored by Tomer Weller, with input from the consulted individuals
mentioned at the top of this document.

## Motivation
Trustline authorization is an important feature of the Stellar protocol. It allows issuers to handle various regulatory requirements. However, it's current behavior is not sensible with regards to configuration changes and revocable assets:
- The authorize (`ALLOW_TRUST, Authorize=AUTHORIZED_FLAG`) operation fails if the issuer does not have any flags set, even when the trustline is unauthorized. This complicates asset configuration changes.
- The revoke (`ALLOW_TRUST, Authorize=0` or `ALLOW_TRUST, Authorize=AUTHORIZED_TO_MAINTAIN_LIABILITIES_FLAG` when `AUTHORIZED_FLAG` is set) operation fails if the issuer does not have the `AUTH_REQUIRED` flag set. This defeats the purpose of having revocable assets that default to authorized trustlines ("Blacklist authorization"). 

### Goals Alignment
This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to create highly usable products

## Specification
This CAP introduces two changes to `ALLOW_TRUST` semantics: 
- Allow `ALLOW_TRUST` operations with `Authorize=AUTHORIZED_FLAG` to be performed regardless of any issuer account flags.   
- Allow `ALLOW_TRUST` operations to be performed on trustlines to assets that have the `AUTH_REVOCABLE` flag set, **regardless of whether or not their `AUTH_REQUIRED` flag is set**.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
This change is backward compatible for sensible consumers. It is not backward compatible for consumers that rely on the above operations failing and returning the `ALLOW_TRUST_TRUST_NOT_REQUIRED` result code.

## Test Cases
//TBD

## Implementation
//TBD
