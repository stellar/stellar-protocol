## Simple Summary

Allow smart contracts to interoperate with Stellar assets.

## Motivation

There is an existing ecosystem of assets on the Stellar Network. Smart contracts
on the Stellar Network will be significantly less useful if it is not possible
to interact with those assets. Therefore, we must build an interoperability
layer.

### Requirements

#### Performance

Tokens are the basic unit of blockchain applications, and as such they should be
very efficient to use.

#### Trust Transitivity

It is not guaranteed that every anchor will take steps to maximize
interoperability between their existing asset and smart contracts. Other
organizations may try to fill that gap, but they will not necessarily have the
same level of trust. For example, consider an asset X issued by account A. If A
deploys smart contracts to maximize interoperability between their existing
asset and other smart contracts, then these smart contracts don't require
trusting an additional organization. Native support to interoperate between an
existing asset and smart contracts would avoid this issue by using trust in the
Stellar protocol.

#### Restricted Privileges

ERC-20 tokens use an allowance model to limit how much of a user's balance can
be spent by a specific smart contract. This makes it relatively safe to
interact with a smart contract, because it cannot steal arbitrarily large
amounts of money. Existing Stellar assets have no such functionality. As a
consequence, it is extremely dangerous to let a smart contract execute a
payment with any account (other than the contract account) as source.

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to
  create highly usable products
- The Stellar Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via
  exchange of assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments
  between assets in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.

## Abstract

This proposal provides an ERC-20 compliant interface for Stellar assets. This
is achieved by introducing two new types of ledger entry, `WrappedBalanceEntry`
and `WrappedAllowanceEntry`, which are used to record ERC-20 state. Atop this,
a `ContractID` for cross-contract invocations is introduced which can refer to
an actual smart contract or to native contracts. In this case, we provide a new
type of native contract with type `ASSET_ADAPTOR` which implements the ERC-20
and compliance interfaces in terms of `WrappedBalanceEntry` and
`WrappedAllowanceEntry`, and which implements the wrapper interface by
transferring funds from accounts and trustlines to wrapped balance entries.

### Semantics

Asset adaptors implement the ERC-20 interface, authorization/clawback, and
wrap/unwrap. They allow smart contracts that can interoperate with ERC-20 tokens
to interoperate with Stellar assets.

Specifically, asset adaptors implement the following

```rust
/******************************************************************************\
*
* ERC-20 Interface
*
\******************************************************************************/
// name is intended to comply with SEP-11
// Returns "NATIVE" for ASSET_TYPE_NATIVE
// Returns format!("{}:{}", assetCode, issuer) for ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM4
// Returns format!("{}:{}", assetCode, issuer) for ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM12
fn name() -> String;

// symbol is intended to comply with SEP-11
// Returns "NATIVE" for ASSET_TYPE_NATIVE
// Returns assetCode for ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM4

fn decimals() -> u8;

// Returns total supply
fn totalSupply() -> uint256;

// Returns balance of owner
fn balanceOf(owner: AccountID) -> uint256;

// Returns false if !isAuthorized(msg.sender)
// Returns false if !isAuthorized(to)
// Returns false if balanceOf(msg.sender) < value
// Returns false if balanceOf(to) > UINT256_MAX - value
// Debits value from msg.sender
// Credits value to to
// Returns true
fn transfer(to: AccountID, value: uint256) -> bool;

// Returns false if !isAuthorized(msg.sender)
// Returns false if !isAuthorized(from)
// Returns false if !isAuthorized(to)
// Returns false if balanceOf(from) < value
// Returns false if balanceOf(to) > UINT256_MAX - value
// Returns false if allowance(msg.sender) < value
// Debits value from Approval(from, msg.sender, asset)
// Debits value from from
// Credits value to to
// Returns true
fn transferFrom(from: AccountID, to: AccountID, value: uint256) -> bool;

// Sets ApprovalEntry {
//     transferFrom: msg.sender,
//     spender: spender,
//     asset: asset,
//     amount: value,
// }
// Returns true on success
fn approve(spender: AccountID, value: uint256) -> bool;

// Returns Allowance(owner, spender, asset).amount
fn allowance(owner: AccountID, spender: AccountID) -> uint256;

/******************************************************************************\

// Clears authorized for account
// Returns true
fn deauthorize(account: AccountID) -> bool;

// Returns false if account is not authorized
// Returns true
fn isAuthorized(account: AccountID) -> bool;

// Returns false if msg.sender != asset.issuer
// Returns false if !(Account(msg.sender).flags & AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG)
// Returns false if balanceOf(from) < value
// Debits value from from
// Decreases total supply by value
// Returns true
fn clawback(from: AccountID, value: uint256) -> bool;

/******************************************************************************\
*

*
\******************************************************************************/
// Returns false if !isAuthorized(msg.sender)
// Returns false if balanceOf(msg.sender) > UINT256_MAX - value
// Returns false if TrustLine(msg.sender, asset) doesn't exist
// Returns false if !(TrustLine(msg.sender, asset).flags & AUTHORIZED_FLAG)
// Returns false if TrustLine(msg.sender, asset).availableBalance() < value
// Debits value from TrustLine(msg.sender, asset)
// Credits value to msg.sender
// Increases total supply by value
// Returns true
fn wrap(value: uint256) -> bool;

// Returns false if !isAuthorized(msg.sender)
// Returns false if balanceOf(msg.sender) < value
// Returns false if TrustLine(msg.sender, asset) doesn't exist
// Returns false if !(TrustLine(msg.sender, asset).flags & AUTHORIZED_FLAG)
// Returns false if TrustLine(msg.sender, asset).availableLimit() < value
// Debits value from msg.sender
// Credits value to TrustLine(msg.sender, asset)
// Decreases total supply by value
// Returns true
fn unwrap(value: uint256) -> bool;
```

Asset adaptors don't have normal contract addresses, because they always exist
and have no on-chain representation. Instead, an asset adaptor contract address
is simply identified by a `ContractID` of type `ASSET_ADAPTOR` that contains the
specified asset. We will need a host function like

```rust
fn get_asset_adaptor(asset: Asset) -> ContractID;
```

## Design Rationale

### Satisfies Requirements: Performance

The entire implementation will be on the host, meaning it can leverage direct
access to the processor and data store.

### Satisfies Requirements: Trust Transitivity

The asset adaptor is an extension of the issuer's authority to smart contracts,
without requiring trust for any other party.

### Satisfies Requirements: Restricted Privileges

An account will have to call `wrap` directly in order to prepare assets from
their trustline for use in smart contracts, and these functions can be trusted
because they are part of the protocol. Once assets are wrapped, they are subject
to the ERC-20 allowance mechanism to protect them.

### Wrap/Unwrap Friction Is Acceptable

The standard scheme to use an ERC-20 token with a smart contract is to set an
allowance for that smart contract. Setting the allowance for the smart contract
is also an opportunity to simultaneously wrap Stellar assets into the adaptor.

The core assumption here is that accounts are not doing a constant mixture of
Stellar operations and smart contract interactions. I anticipate that usage is
much more likely to go in phases: prepare Stellar asset for utilization in a
smart contract, leave it there for some time possibly moving it to other smart
contracts, bring Stellar asset back. This usage pattern is reasonable given that
most smart contracts take control of the asset anyway, requiring it to be
withdrawn before it can be used elsewhere.

### Only Two Authorization States

While trustlines have three authoriztion states (unauthorized, authorized to
maintain liabilities, and authorized), the asset adaptor only has two. This is
because the asset adaptor has no notion of liabilities, so authorized to
maintain liabilities is equivalent to unauthorized.

### No Holder Clawback Enabled Flag

CAP-0035 introduced the trustline flag `TRUSTLINE_CLAWBACK_ENABLED_FLAG` to
preserve backwards compatibility for existing trustlines that did not expect
clawback to be possible. This is not an issue for asset adaptors because
clawback already exists, so any wrapped asset will be subject to the behavior
specified by the issuer's flags.

### Solves Issues from CAP-0048

#### Issue: Issuer Balance

The issuer balance is whatever amount of asset the issuer has wrapped plus
received, minus what they have unwrapped plus sent.

#### Issue: Not Compatible With High Supply Assets

Rather than using trustlines, the asset adaptor actually stores `uint256`
values.

#### Issue: Classic Payments To Contracts

Because the asset adaptor does not use trustlines, contracts cannot receive
classic payments.

#### Issue: Available Balance vs Balance

Asset adaptors have no notion of liabilities, so the balance is the available
balance.

## Protocol Upgrade Transition

### Backwards Incompatibilities

This proposal is completely backwards compatible. It describes a new interface
to existing behavior that is accessible from smart contracts, but it does not
modify the existing behavior.

### Resource Utilization

This proposal adds a new type of ledger entry, which will likely lead to an
increase in the total size of the ledger.
