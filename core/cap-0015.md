## Simple Summary

This CAP introduces the concept of the "Bump Fee Extension" (BFE) to 
allow paying transaction fees by arbitrary account.

## Abstract

There are a few cases that require charging transaction fees to the account 
balance other than `source` account:

- Games, exchanges, and other applications willing to pay user fees. 
- Pre-signed transactions in case of the `base_fee` increase.
- Coordinated multi-sig transactions with insufficient fees. 
- Fee optimization services that can ensure transactions execution in fee 
racing conditions.

This CAP introduces the way for paying fees for any transaction by extending 
TransactionEnvelope XDR.

## Motivation

The problem of paying fees for another account has been discussed multiple 
times. Current solutions are based on multi-sig with source account 
replacement or direct [fees "refund"](
https://www.lumenauts.com/blog/better-stellar-fee-channels) for user accounts. 
However, both approaches are not ideal and require multi-sig coordination. 
With the proposed transaction envelope extension users can sign and submit 
transactions to the application server endpoint which automatically modifies 
the envelope to allow paying fees from another account. 

In the case of `base_fee` protocol parameter increase, long-lived preauthorized 
transactions may become invalid because of insufficient fees. Currently, we 
have no mechanism that would allow changing fees for such transactions, or 
"pushing" them to the ledger in any other way. 


## Specification

We introduce three new fields in the TransactionEnvelope XDR: 
- `replaceFeeSourceAccount` represents the sponsor account for charging fees
- `replaceFee` is a maximum fee the sponsor account is willing to pay
- `replaceFeeSignatures` contains signatures for the sponsor account

```c++
struct TransactionEnvelope
{
    Transaction tx;
    DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;

    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 1:
        struct
        { 
            // Account ID to charge fees
	        AccountID replaceFeeSourceAccount;
            // the max fee the replaceFeeSourceAccount will pay
            uint32 replaceFee;
            // signatures from replaceFeeSourceAccount signers
            DecoratedSignature replaceFeeSignatures<20>;
       
            union switch (int v)
            {
                case 0:
                    void;
            } ext;
        } v1;
    }
    ext;
};
```

To confirm the intention to pay fees for the specific transaction on behalf of 
the sponsor account, `replaceFeeSignatures` should contain valid signatures from 
signers of the sponsor account and their total weight should satisfy the 
`low_threshold`. 

The structure for signing should contain the following fields:
 
- transaction hash
- `replaceFee` value
- `replaceFeeSourceAccount` value

Whenever the validator receives an envelope with `replaceFee` value set, it 
loads the account specified as `replaceFeeSourceAccount` and checks the 
signatures. If the signatures are valid and low threshold for the 
`replaceFeeSourceAccount` is met, the validator adds the `replaceFee` amount 
to the original transaction `fee` bid. 

Fee charging logic for such transactions follows general 
[CAP-0005](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0005.md) convention.
For the envelopes with bump fee logic, validators should increase the `minfee` 
by the `base_fee` amount to prevent intentional BFE spamming. Envelops with 
`replaceFee` amount lower than current `base_fee` are to be discarded.

## Rationale

The proposed solution requires minimum protocol changes and covers a wide 
range of potential use-cases leaving a room for the possible future 
modifications. It also resolves the problem of long-lived preauthorized 
transactions. 

Transaction envelops with bump fee extension follow the standard lifecycle, 
do not require new operations or fundamental changes in ledger entities. 
Fees for any transaction envelope can be set at any time and resubmitted 
more than once, for example, in case if the `replaceFee` amount was not enough.

The transaction fee can be updated implicitly, without any interaction 
with a user, which provides a consistent user experience. At the same time, 
the fee sponsor account retains full control and is able to refuse sponsoring 
fees in any particular situation.
