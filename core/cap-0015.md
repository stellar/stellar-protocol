## Simple Summary

This CAP introduces the concept of the "Fee Bump Transaction" (BFE) to
allow paying transaction fees by arbitrary account.

## Abstract

There are a few cases that require charging transaction fees to the
account balance other than `source` account:

- Games, exchanges, and other applications willing to pay user fees.

- Pre-signed transactions in case of the `base_fee` increase.

- Coordinated multi-sig transactions with insufficient fees.

- Fee optimization services that can ensure transactions execution in
  fee racing conditions.

This CAP introduces the way for paying fees for any transaction by
extending TransactionEnvelope XDR.

## Motivation

The problem of paying fees for another account has been discussed
multiple times. Current solutions are based on multi-sig with source
account replacement or direct [fees "refund"](
https://www.lumenauts.com/blog/better-stellar-fee-channels) for user
accounts.  However, both approaches are not ideal and require
multi-sig coordination.  With the proposed transaction envelope
extension users can sign and submit transactions to the application
server endpoint which automatically modifies the envelope to allow
paying fees from another account.

In the case of `base_fee` protocol parameter increase, long-lived
preauthorized transactions may become invalid because of insufficient
fees. Currently, we have no mechanism that would allow changing fees
for such transactions, or "pushing" them to the ledger in any other
way.


## Specification

A Fee Bump Transaction actually consists of two separate transactions,
an inner and outer transaction.  We specify the XDR for these
transactions followed by the semantics.

### XDR changes

Using the proposed [Future-upgradable
TransactionEnvelope](cap-0019.md) feature, this CAP introduces a new
kind of transaction called `FeeBump`:

~~~~ {.c}
enum EnvelopeType
{
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0 = 0,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCP = 1,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX = 2,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_AUTH = 3,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP = 4  // new
};

struct FeeBumpTransaction {
    AccountID feeSource;
    uint64 fee;
    TimeBounds *timeBounds;
    union switch (EnvelopeType type) {
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
        struct {
            Transaction tx;
            /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
             * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
            DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
        } v1;
    } innerTx;
}

struct TransactionSignaturePayload
{
    Hash networkId;
    union switch (EnvelopeType type)
    {
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
        Transaction tx;
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP:
        Transaction4 feeBumpTx;
    }
    taggedTransaction;
};

/* A TransactionEnvelope wraps a transaction with signatures. */
union TransactionEnvelope switch (EnvelopeType type) {
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0:
    struct {
        Transaction0 tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v0;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
    struct {
        Transaction tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v1;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP:
    struct {
        FeeBumpTransaction tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } feeBump;
};
~~~~

To confirm the intention to pay fees for the specific transaction on
behalf of the sponsor account, `signatures` should contain signatures
satisfying the `low_threshold` of the `feeSource` account.  These
signatures do not contribute to the signing weight of `innerTx`--only
`innerTx.signatures` contributes to the inner transaction.  In other
words, `innerTx` must be valid on except for `innerTx.tx.fee`, which
no longer matters.

### Semantics

The fee charging logic for `FeeBump` transactions follows
[CAP-0005](cap-0005.md), with the following changes:

* To decide inclusion in a transaction set and compute its effective fee, a
  `FeeBump` transaction is equivalent to a transaction with a number of
  operations that is one greater than the number of operations
  in `innerTx` and with a max fee equal to its `fee` field.
    * This effectively makes the fee bump count as an additional operation.
    * The `fee` field of `innerTx` is completely ignored.

* If `innerTx` does have a sufficient `fee` field, it is possible for
  both `innerTx` and the `FeeBump` transaction to be included in the
  transaction set. In that case, the network double-charges for the
  transaction, as both the `sourceAccount` and the `feeSource` end up
  paying.

* If multiple `FeeBump` transactions are submitted with the same `innerTx`,
  the network can include them in the transaction set and double-charge for
  the fee bumps.

* When closing a ledger containing a `FeeBump` transaction, if `innerTx` was not already present in the transaction set, it gets added to the transaction set right before computing the "apply order", and its associated
  effective fee is 0.

* For surge pricing, `FeeBump` transactions are added to the transaction queue
  of `innerTx`'s source account (so to ensure that sequence numbers are respected).

* At the overlay layer, some additional policy may be implemented, such as
  limiting the number of pending `FeeBump` transactions per `feeSource`.

### Results

When one or more `FeeBump` transactions execute for a given `innerTx`,
the results always include one `TransactionResultPair` for the
`innerTx` (which will contain a `feeCharged` of `0` if it was not already present in the transaction set), and one for each `FeeBumpTransaction` that was charged a fee.

A `FeeBumpTransaction` has a new result type that is present regardless of whether the
underlying `innerTx` succeeded or failed.

~~~~ {.c}
enum TransactionResultCode
{
    txFEE_BUMPED = 1, // a fee bump transaction executed

    // ... rest as is
};

struct FeeBumpResult {
    Hash innerTxHash;
};

struct TransactionResult
{
    int64 feeCharged; // actual fee charged for the transaction

    union switch (TransactionResultCode code)
    {
    case txSUCCESS:
    case txFAILED:
        OperationResult results<>;
    case txFEE_BUMPED:
        FeeBumpResult feeBumpResult;
    default:
        void;
    }
    result;

    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};
~~~~

## Rationale

The proposed solution requires minimum protocol changes and covers a
wide range of potential use-cases leaving a room for the possible
future modifications. It also resolves the problem of long-lived
preauthorized transactions.

Transaction envelops with bump fee extension follow the standard
lifecycle, do not require new operations or fundamental changes in
ledger entities.  Fees for any transaction envelope can be set at any
time and resubmitted more than once, either from different accounts or
after 10 ledgers have elapsed.

The transaction fee can be updated implicitly, without any interaction
with a user, which provides a consistent user experience. At the same
time, the `feeSource` account retains full control and is able to
refuse sponsoring fees in any particular situation.
