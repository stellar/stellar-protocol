CAP: 0030
Title: Remove NO_ISSUER Operation Results

Protocol version: TBD

## Simple Summary
There are operations that unnecessarily load the issuer, and return an error result if the issuer of an asset was not found. These errors are not necessary, and this proposal aims to remove them.

## Motivation
The following operation results indicate that an operation failed because the issuer of an asset does not exist: `PAYMENT_NO_ISSUER`, `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE_NO_ISSUER`, `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND_NO_ISSUER`, `MANAGE_SELL_OFFER_SELL_NO_ISSUER`, `MANAGE_SELL_OFFER_BUY_NO_ISSUER`, `MANAGE_BUY_OFFER_SELL_NO_ISSUER`, `MANAGE_BUY_OFFER_BUY_NO_ISSUER`, and `CHANGE_TRUST_NO_ISSUER`. Each of the operations that can produce these results other than `ChangeTrustOp` does not otherwise depend on the existence of the issuer. The issuer is only required when creating a trustline with `ChangeTrustOp`. Removing the issuer check from all other operations will standardize the protocol on not requiring the issuer outside of this one case.

Removing the issuer from the operations that produce the `*_NO_ISSUER` results will also prevent `stellar-core` developers from using the `AUTH_REQUIRED` flag incorrectly. If `AUTH_REQUIRED` is not set on the issuer, then the `TrustLine` will be authorized on it's creation. The name `AUTH_REQUIRED`, however, implies that the flag determines if authorization should be checked, which is not the actual logic.

This proposal will also make the CAP-0023 (Two-Part Payments) implementation simpler because we won't need to return the `*_NO_ISSUER` results there to maintain consistency.

### Goals Alignment
The Stellar Network should facilitate simplicity and interoperability with other protocols and networks.

## Specification
For every operation that can return a `*_NO_ISSUER` result except `ChangeTrustOp`, don't load the issuer or return the `*_NO_ISSUER` result.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
The `*_NO_ISSUER` results will no longer be returned for the affected operations, so anyone relying on these results will need to modify their behavior. These error results aren't meaningful anyways because anyone can create the issuer account to bypass the issuer check.
