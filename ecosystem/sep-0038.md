## Summary

This protocol enables anchors to accept off-chain assets in exchange for different on-chain assets, and vice versa. Specifically, it enables anchors to provide quotes that can referenced within the context of existing Stellar Ecosystem Proposals. How the exchange of assets is facilitated is outside the scope of this document.

## Motivation

Anchoring an asset and issuing an asset are distinct functions that have different buisness and technical requirements. However, issuing an asset has often been a prerequisite for anchoring an asset. This protocol enables anchors to transfer value on and off the Stellar network for their clients regardless of whether a one-for-one reserve-backed Stellar asset existed for the off-chain asset held by the anchor's clients.

Removing this requirement for anchors also provides downstream benefits to ecosystem participants generally. Enabling anchors to accept any Stellar asset will naturally decrease liquidity fragmentation on the decentralized exchange, leading to greater market depth and tigher spreads between trading pairs.

## Specification

### Authentication

All endpoints require authentication in the form of a [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) JSON Web Token (JWT) in the `Authorization` header of the request. Authenticated accounts must exist on the network in order to make requests to `POST /quote`, as described in the [Protecting Against Bad Actors](#protecting-against-bad-actors) section.

### Content Type

All endpoints accept in requests the following `Content-Type`:
- `application/json`

All endpoints respond with content type:
- `application/json`

### Endpoints

* [`GET /info`](#get-info)
* [`GET /prices`](#get-prices)
* [`GET /price`](#get-price)
* [`POST /quote`](#post-quote)

### GET Info

This endpoint describes the supported Stellar assets and off-chain currencies available for trading. Note that the anchor may not support a trading pair between every Stellar asset and off-chain currency listed. Use the [`GET /prices`](#get-prices) endpoint to see which pairs are supported.

#### Request

No request arguments required.

#### Response

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`assets` | array | An array of objects describing the Stellar assets available in exchange for one or more of the `currencies` listed.
`currencies` | array | An array of objects describing the off-chain currencies available in exchange for one or more of the `assets` listed.

`assets` Object Schema

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset` | string | The [SEP-32](sep-0032.md) address of the Stellar asset. Lumens should be specified as `XLM`.

`currencies` Object Schema

Name | Type | Description

`currency` | string | The [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) code for the currency.
`delivery_methods` | array | An array of objects describing the methods a client can use to deliver funds to the anchor for a given `currency`. The method of delivery may affect the expiration and/or price provided in a [`POST /quote`](#post-quote) response. The array can be empty if the method of delivery is irrelevant to the anchor.

`delivery_methods` Object Schema

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`name` | string | The value to use when making `POST /quote` requests.
`description` | string | A human readable description of the method identified by `name`.

### GET Prices

This endpoint can be used to fetch the [indicative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicativequote.asp) prices of available off-chain assets in exchange for a Stellar asset and vice versa.

#### Request

Only one of the following parameters should be included in the request.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset` | string | (optional) The [SEP-32](sep-0032.md) address of the Stellar asset you want to get the price of available off-chain currencies in. Lumens should be specified as `XLM`.
`currency` | string | (optional) The [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) code of the currency you want to get the price of available Stellar assets in.

#### Response

Only one of the following attributes should be included in the response.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`assets` | array | (optional) An array of objects containing the available Stellar assets and their prices in terms of the `currency` provided in the request.
`currencies` | array | (optional) An array of objects containing the available currencies and their prices in terms of the `asset` provided in the request.

`assets` Object Schema

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset` | string | Same as the definition of `asset` in the request.
`price` | string | The price of one unit of `asset` in terms the `currency` sent in the request.
`decimals` | integer | The number of decimals needed to represent asset.

`currencies` Object Schema

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`currency` | string | Same as the definition of `currency` in the request.
`price` | string | The price of one unit of `currency` in terms of the `asset` sent in the request.
`decimals` | integer | The number of decimals needed to represent the currency.

### GET Price

This endpoint can be used to fetch the indicative price of a Stellar asset and currency [pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_pair).

#### Request

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`base` | string | The base asset or currency. Ex. `USDC:circle.io`, `ARS`
`counter` | string | The counter asset or currency.
`base_amount` | string | The amount of the base asset or currency to be traded for the counter asset or currency.

#### Response

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`price` | string | The price of one unit of the base asset or currency in terms of the counter asset or currency for the `base_amount` specified in the request.

### POST Quote

This endpoint can be used to request a [firm](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firmquote.asp) quote for a Stellar asset and currency pair. 

In contrast with the `GET price(s)` endpoints, the amount requested must be held in reserve and not used in calculations of subsequent quotes until the expiration provided in the response.

#### Protecting Against Bad Actors

To protect against bad actor clients reserving all available captial without following through with the requested trades, servers should only accept requests for which the following is true:

1. The Stellar account authenticated via SEP-10 is owned by a known and trusted entity, or
2. The owner of the Stellar account has been properly KYC'ed, either via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md) or some other mechanism.

Entities or individuals that misuse the service can be placed on a denylist that should be checked before processing requests for quotes.

#### Transaction Fees

It should be expected that the provided quote includes a margin for the provider as a service fee, and this margin will vary depending on the directional flow of funds.

If the client requests some amount of off-chain currency for providing some amount of a Stellar asset, the client will submit a Stellar transaction delievering funds to the anchor before the expiration included in the response, paying a fee as determined by state of the Stellar network. 

In the reverse scenario, the anchor will submit a Stellar transaction to deliver funds to the client as long as the client delivered off-chain funds to the anchor before the expiration. In this case, the anchor will likely increase their margin to cover the cost of submitting the transaction.

This specification could be extended in the future to include functionality where the anchor collects a transaction signature  from the client prior to submitting the transaction, enabling the anchor to have the client pay the network fees and decrease their margin. This feature would increase the technical complexity of the specification and hence will only be added if there is enough support from the ecosystem.

#### Request

`counter` | string | Same as the definition of `counter` in `GET /price`.

`delivery_method` | string | (optional) One of the `name` values specified by the `delievery_methods` array for the relevant currency returned from `GET /info`. If the array is empty, this parameter is not required.

#### Response

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | The unique identifier for the quote to be used in other Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs).
