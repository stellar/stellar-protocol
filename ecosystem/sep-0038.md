## Summary

This protocol enables anchors to accept off-chain assets in exchange for different on-chain assets, and vice versa. Specifically, it enables anchors to provide quotes that can referenced within the context of existing Stellar Ecosystem Proposals. How the exchange of assets is facilitated is outside the scope of this document.

## Motivation

Anchoring an asset and issuing an asset are distinct functions that have different business and technical requirements. However, issuing an asset has often been a prerequisite for anchoring an asset. This protocol enables anchors to transfer value on and off the Stellar network for their clients regardless of whether a one-for-one reserve-backed Stellar asset exists for the off-chain asset held by the anchor's clients.

Removing this requirement for anchors also provides downstream benefits to ecosystem participants generally. Enabling anchors to accept any Stellar asset will naturally decrease liquidity fragmentation on the decentralized exchange, leading to greater market depth and tighter spreads between trading pairs.

## Specification

### Authentication

All endpoints require authentication in the form of a [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) JSON Web Token (JWT) in the `Authorization` header of the request. 

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### Content Type

All endpoints accept in requests the following `Content-Type`:
- `application/json`

All endpoints respond with content type:
- `application/json`

### Errors

If an error occurs when calling any endpoint, an appropriate HTTP status code
will be returned along with an error response.

#### Status Code

Common HTTP status codes may be returned for a server. In particular the following are expected:

Status Code | Name | Reason
-----|------|------------
`400` | Bad Request | The request is invalid in any way.
`403` | Permission Denied | No `Authorization` header has been provided or the contents of the header are not accepted as valid.

The response body must contain a human-readable description of the reason for error:

```json
{
  "error": "The requested asset is not supported. See GET /prices for supported assets."
}
```

### Asset Identification Format

This protocol can be used to provide quotes for any class of asset in exchange for a Stellar asset. The following format is used to identify an asset in API requests and responses.

```
<scheme>:<identifer>
```

The currently accepted `scheme` values are:

Name | Description
-----|------------
`stellar` | Used for Stellar assets.
`iso4217` | Used for fiat currencies.

`stellar` Identifier Format

The [SEP-11](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0011.md#asset) asset format.

`iso4217` Identifier Format

The [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) three-character currency code for the fiat currency.

For example, Stellar USDC would be identified as:

```
stellar:USDC:GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN
```

Fiat USD would be identified as:

```
iso4217:USD
```

```

### POST Quote

This endpoint can be used to request a [firm](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firmquote.asp) quote for a Stellar asset and off-chain asset pair. 

In contrast with the `GET price(s)` endpoints, the amount requested must be held in reserve and not used in calculations of subsequent quotes until the expiration provided in the response.

#### Protecting Against Bad Actors

To protect against bad actor clients reserving all available captial without following through with the requested trades, servers should only accept requests for quotes from Stellar accounts that belong to entities or individuals that have been properly KYC'ed, either via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md) or some other mechanism.

Servers may deny access to the API if misuse is detected.

#### Transaction Fees

It should be expected that the provided quote includes a margin for the provider as a service fee, and this margin will vary depending on the directional flow of funds.

If the client requests some amount of an off-chain asset for providing some amount of a Stellar asset, the client will submit a Stellar transaction delievering funds to the anchor before the expiration included in the response, paying a fee as determined by state of the Stellar network. 

In the reverse scenario, the anchor will submit a Stellar transaction to deliver funds to the client as long as the client delivered off-chain funds to the anchor before the expiration. In this case, the anchor will likely increase their margin to cover the cost of submitting the transaction.

#### Request

The client must provide either `sell_amount` or `buy_amount`, but not both.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`sell_asset` | string | Same as the definition of `sell_asset` in `GET /price`.
`buy_asset` | string | Same as the definition of `buy_asset` in `GET /price`.
`sell_amount` | string | Same as the definition of `sell_amount` in `GET /price`.
`buy_amount` | string | The same definition of `buy_amount` in `GET /price`.
`expire_after` | [UTC ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) string | (optional) The client's desired `expires_at` date and time for the quote. Anchors should return `400 Bad Request` if the an expiration on or after the requested value cannot be provided.
`delivery_method` | string | (optional) One of the `name` values specified by the `delivery_methods` array for the associated asset returned from `GET /info`. If the array is not provided, this parameter is not required.

#### Response

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | The unique identifier for the quote to be used in other Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs).
`expires_at` | [UTC ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) string | The date and time by which the anchor must receive funds from the client.
`price` | string | The price offered by the anchor for one unit of `buy_asset` in terms of `sell_asset`. In traditional finance, `buy_asset` would be referred to as the base asset and `sell_asset` as the counter asset.
`buy_amount` | string | The amount of `buy_asset` to be exchanged for `sell_asset`. `price * buy_amount = sell_amount` must be true up to the number of decimals required for `buy_asset`.
`sell_amount` | string | The amount of `sell_asset` to be exchanged for `buy_asset`.

### GET Quote

This endpoint can be used to fetch a previously-provided firm quote. Quotes referenced in other protocols must be available at this endpoint past the `expires_at` expiration for the quote.

#### Request

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | The unique identifier for the quote. Same as the `id` returned in the [`POST /quote`](#post-quote) response.

#### Response

This response body should match the response from [POST /quote](#post-quote).

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | The `id` specified in the request.
`expires_at` | [UTC ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) string | The date and time by which the anchor must receive funds from the client.
`price` | string | The price offered by the anchor for one unit of `buy_asset` in terms of `sell_asset`. In traditional finance, `buy_asset` would be referred to as the base asset and `sell_asset` as the counter asset.
