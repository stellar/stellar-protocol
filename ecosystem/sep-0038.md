## Summary

This protocol enables anchors to accept off-chain assets in exchange for different on-chain assets, and vice versa. Specifically, it enables anchors to provide quotes that can referenced within the context of existing Stellar Ecosystem Proposals. How the exchange of assets is facilitated is outside the scope of this document.

## Motivation

Anchoring an asset and issuing an asset are distinct functions that have different business and technical requirements. However, issuing an asset has often been a prerequisite for anchoring an asset. This protocol enables anchors to transfer value on and off the Stellar network for their clients regardless of whether a one-for-one reserve-backed Stellar asset exists for the off-chain asset held by the anchor's clients.

Removing this requirement for anchors also provides downstream benefits to ecosystem participants generally. Enabling anchors to accept any Stellar asset will naturally decrease liquidity fragmentation on the decentralized exchange, leading to greater market depth and tigher spreads between trading pairs.

## Specification

### Authentication

All endpoints require authentication in the form of a [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) JSON Web Token (JWT) in the `Authorization` header of the request. 

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### Content Type

All endpoints accept in requests the following `Content-Type`:
- `application/json`

All endpoints respond with content type:
- `application/json`

### Errors

If an error occurs when calling any endpoint, an appropriate HTTP status code
will be returned along with an error response.

#### Status Code

Common HTTP status codes may be returned for a server. In particular the following are expected:

Status Code | Name | Reason
-----|------|------------
`400` | Bad Request | The request is invalid in any way.
`403` | Permission Denied | No `Authorization` header has been provided or the contents of the header are not accepted as valid.

The response body must contain a human-readable description of the reason for error:

```json
{
  "error": "The requested asset is not supported. See GET /prices for supported assets."
}
```

### Asset Identification Format

This protocol can be used to provide quotes for any class of asset in exchange for a Stellar asset. The following format is used to identify an asset in API requests and responses.

```
<scheme>:<identifer>
```

The currently accepted `scheme` values are:

Name | Description
-----|------------
`stellar` | Used for Stellar assets.
`iso4217` | Used for fiat currencies.

`stellar` Identifier Format

The [SEP-11](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0011.md#asset) asset format.

`iso4217` Identifier Format

The [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) three-character currency code for the fiat currency.

### Endpoints

* [`GET /info`](#get-info)
* [`GET /prices`](#get-prices)
* [`GET /price`](#get-price)
* [`POST /quote`](#post-quote)
* [`GET /quote/:id`](#get-quote)

### GET Info

This endpoint describes the supported Stellar assets and off-chain assets available for trading. Note that the anchor may not support a trading pair between every Stellar asset and off-chain asset listed. Use the [`GET /prices`](#get-prices) endpoint to see which pairs are supported.

#### Request

No request arguments required.

#### Response

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`assets` | array | An array of objects describing the assets available in exchange for one or more of the other assets listed.

`assets` Object Schema

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset` | string | The [Asset Identification Format](#asset-identification-format) value.
`delivery_methods` | array | (optional) Only for non-Stellar assets. An array of objects describing the methods a client can use to deliver funds to the anchor. The method of delivery may affect the expiration and/or price provided in a [`POST /quote`](#post-quote) response.

`delivery_methods` Object Schema

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`name` | string | The value to use when making `POST /quote` requests.
`description` | string | A human readable description of the method identified by `name`.

### GET Prices

This endpoint can be used to fetch the [indicative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicativequote.asp) prices of available off-chain assets in exchange for a Stellar asset and vice versa.

#### Request

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`sell_asset` | string | The asset you want to sell, using the [Asset Identification Format](#asset-identification-format).

#### Response

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`buy_assets` | array | An array of objects containing information on the assets that the client will receive when they provide `sell_asset`.

`buy_assets` Object Schema

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset` | string | The [Asset Identification Format](#asset-identification-format) value.
`price` | string | The price offered by the anchor for one unit of `asset` in terms of `sell_asset`. In traditional finance, `asset` would be referred to as the base asset and `sell_asset` as the counter asset.
`decimals` | integer | The number of decimals needed to represent `asset`.

### GET Price

This endpoint can be used to fetch the indicative price for a given asset pair.

The client must provide either `sell_amount` or `buy_amount`, but not both.

#### Request

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`sell_asset` | string | The asset the client would like to sell. Ex. `USDC:G...`, `iso4217:ARS`
`buy_asset` | string | The asset the client would like to exchange for `sell_asset`.
`sell_amount` | string | The amount of `sell_asset` the client would exchange for `buy_asset`.
`buy_amount` | string | The amount of `buy_asset` the client would like to purchase with `sell_asset`.

#### Response

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`price` | string | The price offered by the anchor for one unit of `buy_asset` in terms of `sell_asset`. In traditional finance, `buy_asset` would be referred to as the base asset and `sell_asset` as the counter asset.
`sell_amount` | string | The amount of `sell_asset` the anchor would exchange for `buy_asset`.
`buy_amount` | string | The amount of `buy_asset` the anchor would provide with `sell_asset`.

### POST Quote

This endpoint can be used to request a [firm](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firmquote.asp) quote for a Stellar asset and off-chain asset pair. 

In contrast with the `GET price(s)` endpoints, the amount requested must be held in reserve and not used in calculations of subsequent quotes until the expiration provided in the response.

#### Protecting Against Bad Actors

To protect against bad actor clients reserving all available captial without following through with the requested trades, servers should only accept requests for quotes from Stellar accounts that belong to entities or individuals that have been properly KYC'ed, either via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md) or some other mechanism.

Servers may deny access to the API if misuse is detected.

#### Transaction Fees

It should be expected that the provided quote includes a margin for the provider as a service fee, and this margin will vary depending on the directional flow of funds.

If the client requests some amount of an off-chain asset for providing some amount of a Stellar asset, the client will submit a Stellar transaction delievering funds to the anchor before the expiration included in the response, paying a fee as determined by state of the Stellar network. 

In the reverse scenario, the anchor will submit a Stellar transaction to deliver funds to the client as long as the client delivered off-chain funds to the anchor before the expiration. In this case, the anchor will likely increase their margin to cover the cost of submitting the transaction.

#### Request

The client must provide either `sell_amount` or `buy_amount`, but not both.

Name | Type | Description

`expire_after` | [UTC ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) string | (optional) The client's desired `expires_at` date and time for the quote. Anchors should return `400 Bad Request` if the an expiration on or after the requested value cannot be provided.
`delivery_method` | string | (optional) One of the `name` values specified by the `delivery_methods` array for the associated asset returned from `GET /info`. If the array is not provided, this parameter is not required.

#### Response
