## Summary

This protocol enables anchors to accept off-chain assets in exchange for different on-chain assets, and vice versa.
Specifically, it enables anchors to provide quotes that can be referenced within the context of existing Stellar
Ecosystem Proposals. How the exchange of assets is facilitated is outside the scope of this document.

## Motivation

Anchoring an asset and issuing an asset are distinct functions that have different business and technical requirements.
However, issuing an asset has often been a prerequisite for anchoring an asset. This protocol enables anchors to
transfer value on and off the Stellar network for their clients regardless of whether a one-for-one reserve-backed
Stellar asset exists for the off-chain asset held by the anchor's clients.

Removing this requirement for anchors also provides downstream benefits to ecosystem participants generally. Enabling
anchors to accept any Stellar asset will naturally decrease liquidity fragmentation on the decentralized exchange,
leading to greater market depth and tighter spreads between trading pairs.

## Specification

### stellar.toml

An anchor must define the location of their `ANCHOR_QUOTE_SERVER` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md). This is how a
wallet knows where to find the anchor's server.

### Authentication

This protocol's endpoints use authentication in the form of a [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) JSON Web Token (JWT) in the
`Authorization` header of the request.

Authentication is mandatory for [`POST /quote`](#post-quote) and [`GET /quote/:id`](#get-quote), but optional for the
remaining endpoints. When optional, if authentication is provided it can be used to personalize the respective
responses.

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### Content Type

All endpoints accept in requests the following `Content-Type`:

- `application/json`

All endpoints respond with content type:

- `application/json`

### Errors

If an error occurs when calling any endpoint, an appropriate HTTP status code will be returned along with an error
response.

#### Status Code

Common HTTP status codes may be returned for a server. In particular the following are expected:

| Status Code | Name              | Reason                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`       | Bad Request       | The request is invalid in any way.                                                                   |
| `403`       | Permission Denied | No `Authorization` header has been provided or the contents of the header are not accepted as valid. |

The response body must contain a human-readable description of the reason for error:

```json
{
  "error": "The requested asset is not supported. See GET /prices for supported assets."
}
```

### Asset Identification Format

This protocol can be used to provide quotes for any class of asset in exchange for a Stellar asset. The following format
is used to identify an asset in API requests and responses.

```
<scheme>:<identifer>
```

The currently accepted `scheme` values are:

| Name      | Description               |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| `stellar` | Used for Stellar assets.  |
| `iso4217` | Used for fiat currencies. |

`stellar` Identifier Format

The [SEP-11](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0011.md#asset) asset format.

`iso4217` Identifier Format

The [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) three-character currency code for the fiat currency.

For example, Stellar USDC would be identified as:

```
stellar:USDC:GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN
```

Fiat USD would be identified as:

```
iso4217:USD
```

### Endpoints

- [`GET /info`](#get-info)
- [`GET /prices`](#get-prices)
- [`GET /price`](#get-price)
- [`POST /quote`](#post-quote)
- [`GET /quote/:id`](#get-quote)

### GET Info

This endpoint describes the supported Stellar assets and off-chain assets available for trading. Note that the anchor
may not support a trading pair between every Stellar asset and off-chain asset listed. Use the
[`GET /prices`](#get-prices) endpoint to see which pairs are supported.

#### Authentication

Optional [`SEP-10`]. If authentication is provided it can be used to personalize the response.

#### Request

No request arguments required.

#### Response

A `200 Success` status code should be returned for successful requests.

### GET Prices

This endpoint can be used to fetch the [indicative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicativequote.asp) prices of
available off-chain assets in exchange for a Stellar asset and vice versa.

These prices are indicative. The actual price will be calculated at conversion time once the Anchor receives the funds
from a User.

The prices returned include any margin that the provider may keep as a service fee, and this margin may vary depending
on the directional flow of funds, amount, delivery method, country code, or other factors.

```
GET /prices?sell_asset=iso4217:BRL&sell_amount=500&country_code=BRA&sell_delivery_method=PIX
```

```json
{
  "buy_assets": [
    {

### GET Price

This endpoint can be used to fetch the indicative price for a given asset pair.

The client must provide either `sell_amount` or `buy_amount`, but not both.

These prices are indicative. The actual price will be calculated at conversion time once the Anchor receives the funds
from a User.

Fees can be collected by adding a margin to the price, and/or by deducting an amount from the funds provided by or
delivered to the client. Both the margin and the fees may vary depending on the directional flow of funds, amount,
delivery method, country code, context or other factors.

### Price Formulas

The following should hold true for all prices and quotes returned in the SEP-38 responses.

```js
sell_amount = total_price * buy_amount;
```

```js
sell_amount - fee = price * buy_amount    // when `fee` is in `sell_asset`

- or -

sell_amount = price * (buy_amount + fee)  // when `fee` is in `buy_asset`
```

### POST Quote

This endpoint can be used to request a [firm](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firmquote.asp) quote for a Stellar
asset and off-chain asset pair.

In contrast with the `GET /price` and `GET /prices` endpoints, the amount requested must be held in reserve and not used
in calculations of subsequent quotes until the expiration provided in the response.

#### Protecting Against Bad Actors

To protect against bad actor clients reserving all available capital without following through with the requested
trades, servers should only accept requests for quotes from Stellar accounts that belong to entities or individuals that
have been properly KYC'ed, either via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md) or some other mechanism.

Servers may deny access to the API if misuse is detected.

#### Transaction Fees

Fees can be collected by adding a margin to the price, and/or by deducting an amount from the funds provided by or
delivered to the client. Both the margin and the fees may vary depending on the directional flow of funds, amount,
delivery method, country code, context or other factors.

If the client requests some amount of an off-chain asset for providing some amount of a Stellar asset, the client will
submit a Stellar transaction delievering funds to the anchor before the expiration included in the response, paying a
fee as determined by state of the Stellar network.

In the reverse scenario, the anchor will submit a Stellar transaction to deliver funds to the client as long as the
client delivered off-chain funds to the anchor before the expiration. In this case, the anchor will likely increase
their margin to cover the cost of submitting the transaction.

#### Authentication

[`SEP-10`].

#### Request

The client must provide either `sell_amount` or `buy_amount`, but not both.

Unless the list included in the `GET /info` response is empty or missing for the associated off-chain asset, the client
must also provide either `sell_delivery_method` or `buy_delivery_method`, but not both.
