## Summary

This proposal defines a format for specifying memorable addresses to reference
assets using the assets code and a domain name that together can be used to
resolve, with confidence, the assets issuing address.

## Motivation

There is no consistent user-friendly approach to referencing or resolving
unique assets in products that are built on Stellar.

Products built on Stellar can hardcode specific assets known by that product
and display those assets using friendly hardcoded names, or they can retrieve
the home domain for the asset's issuer account.

These strategies allow wallets to display user-friendly names for assets but
these approaches have limitations.

Wallets that hardcode names are unable to display user-friendly names for
assets that they do not have prior knowledge.

Wallets that use the home domain of an issuer addres can display user-friendly
names but only if they already know the complete issuer address. Also, the home
domain field of an issuer address does not provide confidence that the domain
is related to the issuer of the asset because any Stellar account holder can
set any domain as their home domain.

Outside of these two approaches users are left referring to assets by their
fully qualified names using their code and issuer address in forms such as
`{asset-code}:{asset-issuer}`, e.g.
`USD:GBAFEDJ6BNM72RXA45CRLFCAQFHRZUKPNK74SNCPFWHI2GMMGA6QAJME`.

## Abstract

This proposal defines a format for specifying memorable addresses that contains
a domain (e.g. `example.org`) instead of a Stellar address for the issuing
account. The domain hosts a `stellar.toml` containing information about the
asset which is already a common practice of asset issuers. A client parses the
`stellar.toml` of the domain in the asset address and retrieves from the file
the issuer address for the asset.

Reverse verification of an asset issuer address and domain can be performed by
comparing the home domain of the issuer address with the issuer address in the
domains `stellar.toml` file to confirm that the domain and issuer both claim to
issue the asset.

## Specification

### Asset Address Format

This proposal defines a format for specifying memorable addresses that resolve
to the asset code and asset issuer and can be used to confidently reference an
asset.

The format is:

```
{asset-code}:{asset-domain}
```

Where:
- `{asset-code}` is the 1-12 alphanumeric [Stellar asset code].
- `{asset-domain}` the domain name that is hosting a `stellar.toml` file that
  contains a [`CURRENCIES`] section for the asset, as defined by [SEP-1].

Example:

```
USD:example.com
```

### Resolving an Asset Address

The process of resolving an asset address is the process of finding the asset
issuing `G...` address given an asset-code or asset-domain in the asset address
format.

The flow to resolve an asset is as follows:
- The client receives an address address in the format
  `{asset-code}:{asset-domain}`.
- The client splits the asset address on `:` into two parts, the asset code and
  the asset domain.
- The client retrieves the `stellar.toml` for the domain located at
  `https://{asset-domain}/.well-known/stellar.toml`.
- The client parses the `stellar.toml` and finds a `CURRENCIES` section with
  `code` equal to `{asset-code}`.
- The client retrieves any currency.toml files as reference by the
  `stellar.toml` as required.
- If none is found, the client finds a `CURRENCIES` section with
  `code_template` that matches `{asset-code}`.
- If none is found, the client fails to resolve the asset address.
- If one is found, the client continues to resolve the asset's issuer address.
- The client reads the `issuer` field of the found `CURRENCIES` section and
  uses it to send payments, create trustlines, etc.
- The client then performs verification of the asset address, see [Verifying an
  Asset Address](#verifying-an-asset-address).

### Verifying an Asset Address

The process of verifying an asset address is the process of confirming that the
domain in an asset address claims to issue an asset from an issuer address that
claims to be owned by that domain.

The flow to verify that an asset issuer and domain participate in the issuing
of an asset is as follows:
- The client goes through the process as documented in [Resolving an Asset
  Address](#resolving-an-asset-address).
- The client retrieves the home domain for the issuer address.
- The client compares the `issuer` value with the asset issuer.
- The client compares the home domain value with the asset domain.

## Security Concerns

The security concerns of this proposal are similar to the security concerns of
[SEP-1 stellar.toml], [SEP-2 Federation protocol], and many systems connected to
the Internet or any network. This includes but is not limited to:
- Preventing unauthorized modification of DNS records.
- Preventing unauthorized modification of stellar.toml and other files defined
  by [SEP-1].

## Limitations

This proposal does not provide mechanisms for changing or migrating the asset
domain of an asset, although clients should follow HTTP redirects.

## Implementations

None at this time, although ideally this proposal if accepted is implemented in
Stellar client SDKs.
