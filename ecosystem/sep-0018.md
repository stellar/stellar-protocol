## Simple Summary

Defines a standard syntax to represent namespaces in data entries.

## Abstract

This SEP provides a standard way to represent [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) into Stellar
accounts data entries.

## Motivation

As a generic mechanism to store key/value pairs on the ledger, data entries accept a very wide range of use cases. If
each actor uses it following its syntax, it will lead to a confusing experience and ultimately to name conflicts.

Introducing namespaces allow to hierarchize and organize data.

This SEP provides guidelines for other SEPs, external applications as well as libraries or utilities dealing with data
entries.

## Specification

Namespace hierarchy is encoded in the key using one or more terms separated by dots. Terms are made of lowercase
letters, underscore and numbers and mustn't start with a number.

**Examples**

```
app.example_org.id
config.memo_required
config.multisig.coordinator
```

- **Term REGEXP:** `[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*`
- **Key REGEXP:** `[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*(\.[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*)*`

## Namespace Registry

To guarantee interoperability and avoid naming conflicts, app-specific data must live under their reserved namespace:

- `app`: Namespace available to app-specific keys. Keys must be defined under `app.{domain}`, with dot(s) replaced by
  underscores. For example, "example.org" defines its keys under `app.example_org`.

Other namespaces have special meaning according to their SEP documents. When a SEP makes use of account data entries, it
must be listed here and referenced:

- `config`: Namespace available for use by ecosystem-wide configuration:
  - `config.memo_required`: [SEP29](sep-0029.md)
  - `config.multisig`: [SEP19](sep-0019.md)

## Rationale

**Syntax**

The namespace syntax had to be familiar, and terms have to be written in a way that is valid across a broad range of
programming languages.

Parsing the data tree must lead to the same namespace/key/value structure regardless of the programming language being
used. This is the reason why term syntax must be restricted, as unusual characters could lead to difficulties or errors.
The lowercase restriction is meant to prevent a different data tree interpretation between case-sensitive and
case-insensitive languages.

**Identifier/namespace conflict**

Conflict occurs when a term is used both as an identifier and a namespace. If for example a data entry with key
`app.example_org.language` exists, and a data entry with key `app.example_org.language.region` exists, an application
parsing the data entries into internal types or data structure will struggle to reconcile how to store the value
assigned to `app.example_org.language`.

```
app.example_org.language = en
app.example_org.language.region = US
```

Applications should avoid defining namespaces that are also identifiers by ensuring namespaces are not given values.
Example:

```
app.example_org.language.language = en
app.example_org.language.region = US
```
