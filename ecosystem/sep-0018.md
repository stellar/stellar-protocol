## Simple Summary

Defines a standard syntax to represent namespaces in data entries.

## Abstract

This SEP provides a standard way to represent
[namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) into Stellar accounts
data entries.

## Motivation

As a generic mechanism to store key/value pairs on the ledger, data entries
accept a very wide range of use cases. If each actor uses it following its
syntax, it will lead to a confusing experience and ultimately to name conflicts.

Introducing namespaces allow to hierarchize and organize data.

This SEP provides guidelines for other SEPs, external applications as well as
libraries or utilities dealing with data entries.

## Specification

Namespace hierarchy is encoded in the key using one or more terms separated by
dots. Terms are made of lowercase letters, underscore and numbers and mustn't
start with a number.

**Examples**

```
config.memo_required
profile.name
profile.language
wallet.btc
wallet.eth
```

* **Term REGEXP:** `[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*`
* **Key REGEXP:** `[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*(\.[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*)*`

## Rationale

**Syntax**

The namespace syntax had to be familiar, and terms have to be written in a way
that is valid across a broad range of programming languages.

Parsing the data tree must lead to the same namespace/key/value structure
regardless of the programming language being used. This is the reason why term
syntax must be restricted, as unusual characters could lead to difficulties or
errors. The lowercase restriction is meant to prevent a different data tree
interpretation between case-sensitive and case-insensitive languages.

**Identifier/namespace conflict**

Conflict occurs when a term is used both as an identifier and a namespace. If
for example a data entry with key `profile.language` exists, and a data entry
with key `profile.language.region` exists, an application parsing the data
entries into internal types or data structure will struggle to reconcile how to
store the value assigned to `profile.language`.

```
profile.language = en
profile.language.region = US
```

Applications should avoid defining namespaces that are also identifiers by
ensuring namespaces are not given values. Example:

```
profile.language.language = en
profile.language.region = US
```

## Namespace Registry

The following namespaces have special meanings and their use should be reserved
for those meanings:

- `config`: Keys defined to define behaviors or limitations of an account, for use in SEP standards.
