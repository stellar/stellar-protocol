## Simple Summary

This SEP defines a list of standard KYC and AML fields for use in Stellar ecosystem protocols. Issuers, banks, and other entities on Stellar should use these fields when sending or requesting KYC / AML information with other parties on Stellar. This is an evolving list, so please suggest any missing fields that you use.

This is a list of possible fields that may be necessary to handle many different use cases, there is no expectation that any particular fields be used for a particular application. The best fields to use in a particular case is determined by the needs of the KYC or AML application.

## Encodings

ISO encodings are used for fields wherever possible. The table below lists the encodings used for different types of information.

Field Type | Number of characters | Format / Encoding
-----------|----------------------|------------------
language | 2 | [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1)
country | 3 | [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)
date | 10 | [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date-only format
phone number | varies | [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)
occupation | 3 | [ISCO08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Classification_of_Occupations)

## Explanation

Where possible we use field names from [schema.org](https://schema.org/Person). Words are separated with underlines as that convention has previously been established in Stellar protocols.

### Addresses

Address formatting varies widely from country to country and even within each country. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11160192/how-to-parse-freeform-street-postal-address-out-of-text-and-into-components) for details. Rather than attempting to create a field for each possible part of an address in every country, this protocol takes a middle of the road approach. Address fields that are fairly universal can be encoded with the `country_code`, `state_or_province`, `city`, and `postal_code` fields. Full addresses, however, should be encoded as a single multi-line string in the `address` field. This allows any address in the world to be represented with a limited number of fields. If address parsing is necessary, parsing will be easier since the country, city, and postal code are already separate fields.
