## Simple Summary

This SEP defines a list of standard KYC, AML, and financial account-related fields for use in Stellar ecosystem
protocols. Applications on Stellar should use these fields when sending or requesting KYC, AML, or financial
account-related information with other parties on Stellar. This is an evolving list, so please suggest any missing
fields that you use.

This is a list of possible fields that may be necessary to handle many different use cases, there is no expectation that
any particular fields be used for a particular application. The best fields to use in a particular case is determined by
the needs of the application.

## Encodings

ISO encodings are used for fields wherever possible. The table below lists the encodings used for different types of
information.

| Field Type   | Number of characters | Format / Encoding                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| language     | 2                    | [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1)                                         |
| country      | 3                    | [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)                       |
| date         | 10                   | [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date-only format                          |
| phone number | varies               | [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)                                                 |
| occupation   | 3                    | [ISCO08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Classification_of_Occupations) |

## Field Naming Conventions

Where possible we use field names from [schema.org](https://schema.org/Person). Words are separated with underlines as
that convention has previously been established in Stellar protocols.

### Dot Notation

Field names should always be used as strings. For example:

```json
{
  "organization.name": "Stellar Development Foundation"
}
```

The dot notation is _not_ an indication that the fields described should be contained in a nested object under a
top-level key.

## Financial Account Fields

These fields should be used to request or provide information about off-chain financial accounts. Because both natural
persons and organizations can use the same types of financial accounts, these fields can be used to request or provide
information about natural persons or organizations. The `organization.` prefix should be used when requesting or
providing fields related to an organization.

Note that some of these fields are generic, such as `bank_number`, which could potentially be used to identify a bank in
any country, and some fields are specific to a given country, such as `cbu_number`, which contains a bank number in
addition to other pieces of information. In order to optimize for the user's experience, it is recommended that
applications use fields that are the most familiar, which are often specific to a given country or financial system.

## Addresses

Address formatting varies widely from country to country and even within each country. See
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11160192/how-to-parse-freeform-street-postal-address-out-of-text-and-into-components)
for details. Rather than attempting to create a field for each possible part of an address in every country, this
protocol takes a middle of the road approach. Address fields that are fairly universal can be encoded with the
`country_code`, `state_or_province`, `city`, and `postal_code` fields. Full addresses, however, should be encoded as a
single multi-line string in the `address` field. This allows any address in the world to be represented with a limited
number of fields. If address parsing is necessary, parsing will be easier since the country, city, and postal code are
already separate fields.
