## Simple Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for anchors and wallets to interact on behalf of users. This improves user experience
by allowing wallets and other clients to interact with anchors directly without the user needing to leave the wallet to
go to the anchor's site. It is based on [SEP-0006](sep-0006.md), but only supports the interactive flow, and cleans up
or removes confusing artifacts. If you are updating from SEP-0006 see the [changes from SEP-6](#changes-from-SEP-6) at
the bottom of this document.

## Abstract

This proposal defines a standard protocol enabling the following features directly within a wallet or other Stellar
client:

- Deposit external assets with an anchor
- Withdraw assets from an anchor
- Communicate deposit & withdrawal fee structure for an anchor to the user
- Handle anchor KYC needs, including handling KYC info within an interactive webapp hosted by the anchor
- Check the status of ongoing deposits or withdrawals involving the user
- View history of deposits and withdrawals involving the user

To support this protocol an anchor acts as a server and implements the specified REST API endpoints, while a wallet
implements a client that consumes the API. The goal is interoperability, so a wallet implements a single client
according to the protocol, and will be able to interact with any compliant anchor. Similarly, an anchor that implements
the API endpoints according to the protocol will work with any compliant wallet.

## Prerequisites

- The assets issuing account should
  [have a home_domain set](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/issuing-assets.html#discoverablity-and-meta-information)
  so the clients can find the toml file to begin the process.
- An anchor must define the location of their `TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md). This is
  how a wallet knows where to find the anchor's server.
- Anchors and clients must support [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) web authentication to enable authenticated deposits,
  withdrawals, or transaction history lookups.
- If the Anchor supports [SEP-38], `ANCHOR_QUOTE_SERVER` must be defined in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md).

## API Endpoints

- [`POST /transactions/deposit/interactive`](#deposit)
- [`POST /transactions/withdraw/interactive`](#withdraw)
- [`GET /info`](#info)
- [`GET /fee`](#fee): **deprecated** optional (only needed for complex fee structures).
  [`SEP-38 GET /price`](sep-0038.md#get-price) endpoint should be used to communicate fees and exchange rates.
- [`GET /transactions`](#transaction-history)
- [`GET /transaction`](#single-historical-transaction)

## Authentication

As stated, Anchors must support [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) web authentication to enable authenticated deposits, withdrawals,
or transaction history lookups. Clients must submit the JWT previously obtained from the anchor via the
[SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication flow to all API endpoints that provide user data. `/info` should be
unauthenticated, but all other endpoints will require a token.

The JWT should be included in all requests as request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

In the case of the interactive webapp, since the client cannot add the authorization header, we recommend passing a
short-lived JWT via URL query parameters and then using your own backend session scheme for the rest of the interactive
flow. Query parameters can leak, so its important to have this JWT be one-time use, or at least short-lived.

### Shared, Omnibus, or Pooled Accounts

Client applications can use a single Stellar account to hold multiple users' funds. To distinguish users that use the
same Stellar account, the decoded SEP-10 JWT's `sub` value may contain a memo value after the Stellar account
(`G...:2810101841641761712`) OR the `sub` value will be a [Muxed Account (`M...`)](../core/cap-0027.md). The anchor
should use this `sub` attribute in their data model to identify unique users.

This document will refer to these accounts as shared accounts. See the [SEP-10 Memos](sep-0010.md#memos) and
[Muxed Accounts](sep-0010.md#muxed-accounts) sections for more information.

Note that Stellar accounts are either shared or they are not. This means anchors should ensure that a Stellar account
previously authenticated with a memo should not be authenticated later without a memo. Conversely, an account that was
previously authenticated without a memo should not be later authenticated as a shared account.

### Source and Destination Accounts

Note that both the source account of a withdrawal payment and the destination account of a deposit can be different than
the account authenticated via SEP-10.

## Asset Exchanges

This protocol was originally designed to provide conversions between off-chain and on-chain equivalent assets – for
instance `BRL <> BRLT`, `USD <> USDC`, `NGN <> NGNT`, etc. – but it has been updated to make exchanges between off-chain
and on-chain non-equivalent assets like `BRL <> USDC`.

To support the exchange of non-equivalent assets using this protocol, the anchor must allow users to select the
off-chain asset they would like to provide or receive (for deposit and withdrawal, respectively) within the anchor's
interactive flow. The anchor should then display an exchange rate to the user in addition to any fees charged for
facilitating the transaction. Whether this exchange rate is binding or an estimate is up to the anchor, but this
distinction must be communicated to the user.

Finally, anchors should populate the optional attributes listed in the `GET /transaction(s)` endpoints related to
non-equivalent asset transactions, specifically `amount_in_asset`, `amount_fee_asset`, and `amount_out_asset`. This
allows client applications can relay this information, in addition to the amounts specified in the associated
attributes, back to their users.

Alternatively, the Anchor can support the [SEP-38] RFQ API and the `quote_id` attribute in
`POST /transactions/deposit/interactive` and `POST /transactions/withdraw/interactive` requests. This enables wallets to
check the Anchor's exchange rates prior to initiating a transaction and obtain a firm quote to use for an upcoming
transaction.

### Asset Conversions Using the Market Rate

To convert at the market rate, clients get an
[indicative quote](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicativequote.asp) with [SEP-38] and then proceed to calling
the [`POST /transactions/withdraw/interactive`](#withdraw) or [`POST /transactions/deposit/interactive`](#deposit)
endpoints. Market rate conversions executed in this way do not provide a guarantee of the final price to be paid for the
asset. Here is how this kind of conversion should happen in deposits and withdrawals for an asset pair like
`BRL <> USDC`:

#### Deposit:

Considering the user will be making a bank deposit of fiat `BRL` in exchange for `USDC` in the Stellar network:

1. The Wallet checks the assets' market conversion rate with [`SEP-38 GET /price`](sep-0038.md#get-price) and shows the
   estimated price to the user.
1. The Wallet initiates a [`POST /transactions/deposit/interactive`](#deposit) using the parameter `asset_code`.
1. The user proceeds with the off-chain deposit, sending `BRL` to the Anchor's bank account.
1. Upon receiving the off-chain deposit funds, the Anchor converts it to `USDC` using the market rate and sends the
   resulting amount to the user's Stellar account.

#### Withdraw:

Considering the user will be making a Stellar payment of `USDC` in exchange for withdrawing `BRL` in the bank account:

1. The Wallet checks the assets' market conversion rate with [`SEP-38 GET /price`](sep-0038.md#get-price) and shows the
   estimated price to the user.
1. The Wallet initiates a [`POST /transactions/withdraw/interactive`](#withdraw) using the parameter `asset_code`.
1. The user proceeds with the on-chain payment, sending `USDC` to the Anchor's Stellar account.
1. Upon receiving the on-chain withdraw funds, the Anchor converts it to `BRL` using the market rate and sends the
   resulting amount to the user's bank account.

### Asset Conversions Using a Firm Quote

With firm quotes, users are guaranteed an asset price they will pay if they submit the payment and anchor receives the
payment before the quote expiration. Here is how the conversion should happen in deposits and withdrawals for an asset
pair like `USDC <> BRL`:

#### Deposit:

Considering the user will be making a bank deposit of fiat `BRL` in exchange for `USDC` in the Stellar network:

1. The Wallet gets a firm conversion rate in [`SEP-38 POST /quote`](sep-0038.md#post-quote) and shows the price and
   expiration date to the user.
1. The Wallet initiates a [`POST /transactions/deposit/interactive`](#deposit) using the parameter `quote_id` returned
   from the previous step, as well as `asset_code`.
1. The user proceeds with the off-chain deposit, sending `BRL` to the Anchor's bank account before the quote expires.
1. Upon receiving the off-chain deposit funds, the Anchor converts it to `USDC` according with the agreed quote and
   sends the resulting amount to the user's Stellar account.
1. If the user sends the funds after the quote expiration, the Anchor can proceed according with its own policy.

#### Withdraw:

Considering the user will be making a Stellar payment of `USDC` in exchange for withdrawing `BRL` in her bank account:

1. The Wallet gets a firm conversion rate in [`SEP-38 POST /quote`](sep-0038.md#post-quote) and shows the price and
   expiration date to the user.
1. The Wallet initiates a [`POST /transactions/withdraw/interactive`](#withdraw) using the parameter `quote_id` returned
   from the previous step, as well as `asset_code`.
1. The user proceeds with the on-chain payment, sending `USDC` to the Anchor's Stellar account before the quote expires.
1. Upon receiving the on-chain withdraw funds, the Anchor converts it to `BRL` according with the agreed quote and sends
   the resulting amount to the user's bank account.
1. If the user sends the funds after the quote expiration, the Anchor can proceed according with its own policy.

## Cross-Origin Headers

Valid CORS headers are necessary to allow web clients from other sites to use the endpoints. The following HTTP header
must be set for all transfer server responses, including error responses.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

In order for browsers-based wallets to validate the CORS headers, as
[specified by W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request), the preflight request (OPTIONS request) must be
implemented in all the endpoints that support Cross-Origin.

## HTTPS Only

This protocol involves the transfer of value, and so HTTPS is required for all endpoints for security. Wallets and
anchors should refuse to interact with any insecure HTTP endpoints.

## URL Callback signature

_Note that the signature discussed here is only for **URL callbacks** and does not apply to **`postMessage` callbacks**_

This protocol involves the optional use of URL callbacks that the Anchor can issue to update the wallet on `status` of a
transaction. In order to validate the integrity and provenance of the callback, the Anchor MUST include a signature in
the HTTP Header `Signature` or `X-Stellar-Signature` (deprecated).

Wallets should support both headers until the `X-Stellar-Signature` header is removed from the specification.

These headers MUST follow the specification: `t=<timestamp>, s=<base64 signature>` where:

- **timestamp** is the current Unix timestamp (number of seconds since epoch) at the time the callback is sent. This is
  used to assure the freshness of the request and to prevent this request to be replayed in the future.
- **base64 signature** is the base64 encoding of the request signature. We explain below how to compute and verify this
  signature. The signature is computed using the Stellar private key linked to the `SIGNING_KEY` field of the anchor's
  [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md). Note that the timestamp and the Wallet hostname will be part of the signature to
  prevent replay and relay attacks.

It is the wallet's responsibility to:

- Verify the signature using the corresponding Stellar `SIGNING_KEY` field of the anchor's
  [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md).
- Verify the freshness of the request by comparing the `timestamp` in the request with the current timestamp at the time
  of the reception and discard every request above a threshold of few seconds (1 or 2 minute(s) maximum).
- Send a working callback URL (parameter `callback` or `on_change_callback`) to the anchor.

### VERIFY signature

- Check that callback request has `Signature` or `X-Stellar-Signature` (deprecated) header
- Parse the header and extract:
  - Key `t`: **timestamp**
  - Key `s`: **base64 signature**
- Verify the request freshness: _current timestamp_ - **timestamp** < few seconds (1-2 minute(s) max)
- Extract the **body** of the request
- Base64 decode the **base64 signature** to get the **signature**
- Prepare the payload to verify the signature:
  - The **timestamp** (as a string)
  - The character `.`
  - The wallet host to send the callback request to
  - The character `.`
  - The **body**
- Verify the signature using the correct `SIGNING_KEY`

### COMPUTE signature

- Prepare the callback
- Prepare the payload to sign:
  - Current timestamp (as a string)
  - The character `.`
  - The wallet host to send the callback request to
  - The character `.`
  - The callback request body
- Sign the payload `<timestamp>.<host>.<body>` using the Anchor private key
- Base64 encode the signature
- Build the `Signature` or `X-Stellar-Signature` (deprecated) header:
  - `Signature: t=<current timestamp>, s=<base64 encoded signature>`
  - `X-Stellar-Signature: t=<current timestamp>, s=<base64 encoded signature>`

## Content Type

All endpoints accept in requests the following `Content-Type`s:

- `multipart/form-data`
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `application/json`

`multipart/form-data` is only necessary when including binary data type values from [SEP-9](sep-0009.md). Any of the
above encoding schemes may be used when requests do not include binary data.

All endpoints respond with content type:

- `application/json`

## Recommendations

SEP-24 lays out many options for how deposit and withdrawal can work. These are recommendations for getting a wallet or
anchor implementation working with minimal effort while providing a great user experience.

**Note:** Both wallets and anchors should implement a sandbox mode for testing that uses the Stellar testnet and fake
banking rails so counterparties can run through the flow without a need to collaborate.

### Basic Wallet Implementation

- Identify anchors you want to support manually, and test them with your wallet to be sure they work before allowing
  them to be used with your wallet. We encourage you to support as many anchors as possible.
- For each anchor, use information from its [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md) file and its [`/info`](#info) endpoint to
  display useful information to the user about the asset they've picked.
- Provide a UI that allows users to pick an asset, anchor, and amount to use for deposit or withdraw. The UI should
  display the asset's quote (if possible) as well as information such as the address of the anchor and description of
  the asset from the `stellar.toml` file.
- **If [SEP-38] quote API is supported by the anchor**
  - Fetch the asset's exchange rate at the market price using [`SEP-38 GET /price`](sep-0038.md#get-price) API.
  - For the firm quote, use [`SEP-38 POST /quote`](sep-0038.md#post-quote) API and show the quote and expiration time to
    the user.
- **Authentication**
  - Perform [authentication](#authentication) via SEP-10 before hitting those endpoints
- **Make a request to `/transactions/deposit/interactive` or `/transactions/withdraw/interactive`.**
  - This will respond with the interactive url needed to proceed with KYC and deposit/withdraw details.
- **For `/transactions/deposit/interactive` and `/transactions/withdraw/interactive`**
  - Optionally attach any fields from [SEP-9](sep-0009.md) as POST parameters in the `/deposit` or `/withdraw` endpoints
    in order to let the anchor pre-fill them in the interactive flow UI. This is optional, but can create a much nicer
    user experience. `email_address`, `first_name` and `last_name` are good examples of fields to help pre-fill the
    anchors website.
  - Optionally attach [SEP-38] quote id, in order to the anchor to use the quote previously shown to the user.
- **For `/transactions/deposit/interactive`**
  - Handle the interactive flow, handle it as [described in detail](#interactive-customer-information-needed).
  - Handle the [special cases](#special-cases), they're relatively common.
- **For `/transactions/withdraw/interactive`**
  - Handle the interactive flow, handle it as [described in detail](#interactive-customer-information-needed).
  - When the transaction status becomes `pending_user_transfer_start` send the required payment as described in the
    interactive webapp callback or the `/transaction` endpoint. This can be a `payment` or `path_payment` operation.
    Sending payments via `account_merge` or `create_account` is not supported at this time.
  - Some wallets might exchange currencies only once they're ready to send the withdrawal payment, so exchange rate
    fluctuations might require withdrawal values to slightly vary from the originally provided `amount`. Anchors are
    instructed to accept a variation of ±10% between the informed `amount` and the actual value sent to the anchor's
    Stellar account. The withdrawn amount will be adjusted accordingly.
- **Transaction history**
  - Provide a list of historical and current deposits and withdrawals at the [`/transactions`](#transactions) endpoint
    for wallets to show a view of all of a single anchors transactions in a list.
  - Provide status or instructions for a specific deposit or withdraw at the [`/transaction`](#transaction) endpoint

### Basic Anchor Implementation

- Provide a full-featured implementation of [`/info`](#info).
- Implement [SEP-38] to offer better user experience. Wallet would be able to show rates and fees your anchor provides
  early in the process. (Before the user initiates a transaction via interactive UI)
- **For both deposit and withdrawal**:
  - To start an interactive flow, provide the [Customer info needed response](#interactive-customer-information-needed).
  - Some wallets may include other fields indicated in [SEP-9](sep-0009.md) as POST parameters added to the
    `/transactions/deposit/interactive` or `/transactions/withdraw/interactive` endpoints. These can be stored and used
    to pre-populate fields in the interactive flow. This is optional for the wallet to provide and optional for anchors
    to respect, but it does create a much nicer user experience.
  - Some wallets may include `quote_id` fetched from the [`SEP-38 POST /quote`](sep-0038.md#post-quote) API. If
    provided, your implementation must respect the agreed quote.
  - Include the `id` field in your response to `/transactions/deposit/interactive` and
    `/transactions/withdraw/interactive` so the wallet can check up on the status of the transaction if it wants.
  - Also include the `id` field in the popup URL you provide to the wallet. This allows you to keep track of the
    transaction when the user visits the URL.
  - We recommend you use [SEP-10](#authentication) for authentication in the interactive flow and do not separately
    prompt for password to achieve a good user experience (although asking for MFA when confirming a transaction or
    requiring email confirmation is reasonable). Putting a one time use token or quickly expiring JWT in the URL
    returned to the client is a good way to keep continuity between authenticated API calls and fresh interactive flow
    requests.
  - Test your interactive flows on mobile. They should be easy to use on all devices: make them responsive, handle
    auto-fill well, and do smart keyboard management on mobile devices.
- **Interactive deposit**
  - Your interactive deposit popup will do everything needed to initiate the deposit without the user needing to
    interact with the wallet further. It should either directly initiate the deposit, or handle displaying information
    (such as reference number or bank account number) that the user will need to complete their deposit.
- **Interactive withdrawal**
  - Your withdrawal flow will have to pass control back to the user's wallet, so it can initiate the withdrawal with a
    Stellar payment to your withdrawal address. You'll need to communicate the withdrawal address, amount and status to
    the wallet using the [`callback` parameter](#adding-parameters-to-the-url), and also by making it available on your
    `/transaction` endpoint. See [details](#guidance-for-wallets-completing-an-interactive-withdrawal) for polling by
    the wallet.
  - In order to fulfill a withdrawal, a wallet must make a payment to the Stellar address that the anchor provides. It
    is the anchor's job to watch for Stellar payments to the given address and make the external transaction as soon as
    they're detected. Anchors must listen for `payment` and `path_payment`
    [operations](https://www.stellar.org/developers/horizon/reference/endpoints/payments-all.html). Most Stellar SDKs
    already support listening to all payment forms via streaming.
  - When the anchor detects the fulfilling payment from the wallet and expects the customer to pick up the withdrawn
    amount of cash, the transaction status must be changed to `pending_user_transfer_complete` to indicate the withdrawn
    amount is ready for pick-up.
  - Some wallets might exchange currencies only once they're ready to send the withdrawal payment, so there might be
    slight fluctuations of value between the informed withdrawal `amount` and the actual transferred amount. It is
    recommended for anchors to accept an amount fluctuation of up to ±10%, and adjust the amount to be transferred ( and
    fees) to reflect the actual value received.
- **Providing transaction status**
  - Provide the `/transaction` endpoint. The wallet relies on it to complete interactive withdrawals.
  - Provide the `/transactions` endpoint. Wallets normally display transaction histories.

## Deposit

A deposit is when a user sends some non-stellar asset (BTC via Bitcoin network, USD via bank transfer, Cash to a teller,
etc...) to an account held by an anchor. In turn, the anchor sends an equal amount of tokens on the Stellar network
(minus fees) to the user's Stellar account.

If the anchor supports SEP-38 quotes, it can also provide a bridge between non-equivalent tokens. For example, the
anchor can receive ARS via bank transfer and in return send the equivalent value (minus fees) as USDC on the Stellar
network to the user's Stellar account.

The deposit endpoint allows a wallet to get deposit information from an anchor, so a user has all the information needed
to initiate a deposit. It also lets the anchor specify additional information that the user must submit interactively
via a popup or embedded browser window to be able to deposit.

After a successful deposit request has been made, a transaction record with the `id` provided in the response should be
retreivable from `GET /transaction(s)`. This transaction must be in the `incomplete` status until the user has provided
the anchor all information necessary for the transaction to be completed once received off-chain.

If the given account does not exist, or if the account doesn't have a trustline for that specific asset, see the
[Special Cases](#special-cases) section below.

If asset_issuer is not provided, the anchor should use the asset issued by themselves as described in their TOML file. If `native` is specified as the `asset_code`, `asset_issuer` must be not be set. When `quote_id` is specified, this parameter must match the quote's `buy_asset` asset code or be omitted.                                                                 |

If this parameter is provided and the user delivers the deposit funds to the Anchor before the quote expiration, the Anchor must respect the conversion rate agreed in that quote. When `quote_id` is set, `asset_code`, `source_asset` and `amount` must be validated by the anchor, if present.

| `account`                     | `G...` or `M...` string                 | (optional) The Stellar or muxed account the client wants to use as the destination of the payment sent by the anchor. Defaults to the account authenticated via SEP-10 if not specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `memo_type`                   | string                                  | (optional) Type of memo that anchor should attach to the Stellar transaction, one of `text`, `id` or `hash`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `memo`                        | string                                  | (optional) Value of memo to attach to transaction, for `hash` this should be base64-encoded. Because a memo can be specified in the SEP-10 JWT for [Shared Accounts](#shared-omnibus-or-pooled-accounts), this field can be different than the value included in the SEP-10 JWT. For example, a client application could use the value passed for this parameter as a reference number used to match payments made to `account`.                                                          |
| `wallet_name`                 | string                                  | (**deprecated**,optional) In communications / pages about the deposit, anchor should display the wallet name to the user to explain where funds are going. However, anchors should use client_domain (for non-custodial) and `sub` value of JWT (for custodial) to determine wallet information.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

However, anchors should use client_domain (for non-custodial) and `sub` value of JWT (for custodial) to determine wallet information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `lang`                        | string                                  | (optional) Defaults to `en` if not specified or if the specified language is not supported. Language code specified using [RFC 4646] which means it can also accept locale in the format `en-US`. `error` fields in the response, as well as the interactive flow UI and any other user-facing strings returned for this transaction should be in this language.                                                                                                                          |
| `claimable_balance_supported` | boolean                                 | (optional) True if the client supports receiving deposit transactions as a claimable balance, false otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `customer_id`                 | string                                  | (optional) id of an off-chain account (managed by the anchor) associated with this user's Stellar account (identified by the JWT's `sub` field). If the anchor supports [SEP-12], the `customer_id` field should match the [SEP-12] customer's id. `customer_id` should be passed only when the off-chain id is know to the client, but the relationship between this id and the user's Stellar account is not known to the Anchor.                                                       |

When anchor receives a request, it can determine an origin of the request. First, it should check `client_domain` value
of the authentication token. If it's set, this wallet is an origin of the request. Otherwise, `sub` value of the JWT is
the origin of the request. For custodial wallets, anchor should store internal mapping between wallet keys and wallet
domains. Note, that custodial wallets should only use 1 authentication key, so it's easy to map them.

Additionally, any [SEP-9](sep-0009.md) parameters may be passed as well to make the onboarding experience simpler.

When uploading data for fields specified in [SEP-9](sep-0009.md), `binary` type fields (typically files) should be
submitted **after all other fields**. The reason for this is that some web servers require `binary` fields at the end so
that they know when they can begin processing the request as a stream.

Example:

```
POST /transactions/deposit/interactive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

asset_code=USD&email_address=myaccount@gmail.com&account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI
```

### Response

There are several possible kinds of response, depending on whether the anchor needs more information about the user, how
it should be sent to the anchor, and if there are any errors.

Responses are detailed in the [Deposit and Withdraw shared responses](#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) section
below.

#### Special Cases

##### Stellar account does not exist

If the given Stellar `account` does not exist on receipt of the deposit funds, the anchor should use the `CreateAccount`
operation to create the account with at least enough XLM for the minimum reserve and a trust line to the requested asset
(2.01 XLM is recommended). To indicate that account creation is not supported, set the `account_creation` attribute
within `GET /info`'s `features` object to `false`, otherwise clients will assume account creation is supported.

The anchor can add this minimal funding amount to the service fee, but this requires calculating the worth of the
minimum funding amount in units of the requested asset.

Since the anchor doesn't have the user account's secret key, the user must create a trust line to the anchor's asset
before the anchor can send the requested asset tokens to the user's account. The anchor should listen for the user to
establish this trust line. Once the trust line is there, the anchor should send the requested asset tokens to the
account on Stellar to complete the deposit.

If the anchor does not support creating new accounts for users and `account` doesn't exist yet, the anchor should return
a `400 Bad Request` error in the [deposit](#deposit) response. The response body should be a JSON object containing an
`error` field that explains why the request failed.

##### Stellar account doesn't trust asset

The deposit flow can only be fulfilled if the Stellar `account` has established a trust line for the given asset. To
ensure this is accomplished, when initiating the deposit flow, `Wallet` should check if the `account` has a trust line
for the given asset. If it doesn't:

1. `Wallet` checks if `account` has enough XLM to create a trust line. If it does, skip to step `4`.
2. If `account` doesn't have enough XLM, `Wallet` starts listening for transactions to the given `account`, waiting for
   it to have enough XLM for a trust line.
3. When asked for a deposit, `Anchor` detects if `account` has enough XLM to create a trust line. If it doesn't,
   `Anchor` sends the needed amount of XLM to the `Account` for creating a trust line. `Anchor` may charge a service fee
   to cover the cost of the XLM, but this must be communicated to the user.
4. `Anchor` then starts listening for trust line creations for that `account`.
5. `Wallet` detects the arrival of XLM in the `account`, and establishes a trust line.
6. `Anchor` detects the trust line creation in the `account`. If the asset is `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `Anchor` approves the new
   trust line.
7. `Anchor` proceeds with the deposit flow.

##### Claimable Balances

[Claimable Balances](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0023.md) are an optional feature
that enable payments to accounts that do not have a trustline for the asset being deposited. This feature splits a
payment into two separate parts: the creation of a balance, and the claiming of a balance. A claimable balance can be
claimed by the designated claimant (user) after it has been created by the anchor.

Using this feature, anchors will no longer have to wait until the user's Stellar account has a trustline to the asset
before sending funds. Instead, anchors can make the payment using a
[CreateClaimableBalance](https://developers.stellar.org/api/resources/operations/object/create-claimable-balance/)
operation and the user's Stellar account can claim the funds at their own convenience using a
[ClaimClaimableBalance](https://developers.stellar.org/api/resources/operations/object/claim-claimable-balance/)
operation.

**NOTE**: Supporting this feature will be made mandatory in the future. Therefore, it is highly recommended for wallets
to implement this functionality now.

**Wallets**: To support claimable balances wallets must

- Send the additional `claimable_balance_supported` request parameter in the POST `/transactions/deposit/interactive`
  request body.
- Periodically poll for account's available claimable balances.
- Provide a UI that allows users to claim claimable balances.

**Anchors**: To support claimable balances anchors must

- Set the `claimable_balances` attribute within `GET /info`'s `features` object to `true`
- Accept the `claimable_balance_supported` request parameter in `POST /transactions/deposit/interactive` requests
- Submit deposit transactions using `CreateClaimableBalance` operations to Stellar accounts that don't yet have a
  trustline to the asset requested.
- Add the `claimable_balance_id` attribute to their
  [deposit `GET /transaction(s)` responses.](####Fields-for-deposit-transactions)

**Anchors and Wallets**: Both anchors and wallets still must support the aforementioned
[Stellar account doesn't trust asset](#stellar-account-doesnt-trust-asset) flow. Wallets need to be interoperable with
anchors that have not adopted the claimable balance feature and vice versa.

##### Wallet Claimable Balance Flow

1. Make a request to `/transactions/deposit/interactive` and provide the `claimable_balance_supported` request
   parameter.
2. Listen for anchor's callback or poll the transaction endpoint [`/transaction`] for the transaction status.
3. When the transaction status becomes `pending_user_transfer_start`, the user must send the required payment as
   described in the interactive webapp callback or the `/transaction` endpoint.
4. If the anchor doesn't support claimable balances, the anchor's callback or `/transaction(s)` endpoint will contain
   the `pending_trust` status. In this case, use the flow described [above](#stellar-account-doesnt-trust-asset).
5. Otherwise, detect the `claimable_balance_id` value populated in the anchor's `/transaction(s)` endpoint or poll
   Horizon's [/claimable_balances](https://developers.stellar.org/api/resources/claimablebalances/) endpoint for
   outstanding claimable balances. When a claimable balance is detected using either method, the transaction status
   should be `completed`.
6. Claim the balance using the value via the `ClaimClaimableBalance` operation. See the
   ["Claiming Claimable Balances"](#claiming-claimable-balances) section to learn more about how to claim a balance.

##### Claiming Claimable Balances

In order to claim a balance of an asset, the Stellar accounts must establish a trustline to the asset. Adding a
trustline only needs to happen once per asset sent.

Below is an example of how to claim a claimable balance. Omitted from the example is the
[Change Trust](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/start/list-of-operations/#change-trust) operation required if the
Stellar account does not have a trustline.

```javascript
const transaction = new TransactionBuilder(account, {
  fee: 100,
  networkPassphrase: this.network_passphrase,
})
  .addOperation(Operation.claimClaimableBalance({ balanceId }))
  .setTimeout(0)
  .build();
transaction.sign(keypair);
const result = await this.server.submitTransaction(transaction);
```

##### Anchor Claimable Balance Flow

1. Wallets make a request to `/transactions/deposit/interactive` providing the `claimable_balance_supported` request
   parameter.
2. Anchors update their internal database record of the transaction to indicate the wallet supports receiving a
   claimable balance.
3. Users send the external asset to the anchor's off-chain account.
4. Anchors detect that the user's Stellar account doesn't have a trustline.
5. Anchors submits a Stellar transaction containing a claimable balance operation.
6. Anchors update the `/transaction(s)` attriutes `status` to `completed` and `claimable_balance_id` to the ID returned
   in the Horizon response.

##### Claimable Balance Claimants and Predicates

Predicates are one of the
[claimable balance parameters](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/claimable-balance/#parameters) used to craft
a Claimable Balance transaction. They are conditions that must be satisfied in order for the recipient to claim the
balance. Anchors are free to set whichever predicates they feel are necessary in order to claim the balance. If there
are no predicate preferences, `UNCONDITIONAL` allows accounts to claim balances at anytime.

## Withdraw

This operation allows a user to redeem an asset currently on the Stellar network for the real asset (BTC, USD, stock,
etc...) via the anchor of the Stellar asset.

If the anchor supports SEP-38 quotes, it can provide a withdraw that makes a bridge between non-equivalent tokens by
receiving, for instance USDC from the Stellar network and in return sending the equivalent value (minus fees) as NGN to
the user's bank account.

The withdraw endpoint allows a wallet to get withdrawal information from an anchor, so a user has all the information
needed to initiate a withdrawal. It also lets the anchor specify the url for the interactive webapp to continue with the
anchor's side of the withdraw.

After a successful withdraw request has been made, a transaction record with the `id` provided in the response should be
retreivable from `GET /transaction(s)`. Unless the
[no additional information needed](#1-success-no-additional-information-needed) response is returned, this transaction
must be in the `incomplete` status until the user has provided the anchor all information necessary for the transaction
to be completed once received on-chain.

### Request

```
POST TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024/transactions/withdraw/interactive
```

The fields below should be placed in the request body using the `multipart/form-data` encoding.

Request parameters:

| Name                | Type                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `asset_code`        | string                                  | Code of the asset the user wants to withdraw. The value passed must match one of the codes listed in the [/info](#info) response's withdraw object. When `quote_id` is specified, `asset_code` must match the quote's `sell_asset` asset code. `native` is a special `asset_code` that represents the native XLM token.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `asset_issuer`      | string                                  | (optional) The issuer of the stellar asset the user wants to withdraw with the anchor. If `asset_issuer` is not provided, the anchor should use the asset issued by themselves as described in their TOML file. If `native` is specified as the `asset_code`, `asset_issuer` must be not be set. When `quote_id` is specified, `asset_issuer` must match the quote's `buy_asset` asset issuer or be omitted.                                                                                   |
| `destination_asset` | string in [Asset Identification Format] | (optional) The asset user wants to receive. It's an off-chain or fiat asset. If this is not provided, it will be collected in the interactive flow. When `quote_id` is specified, this parameter must match the quote's `buy_asset` asset code or be omitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `amount`            | number                                  | (optional) Amount of asset requested to withdraw. If this is not provided it will be collected in the interactive flow. When `qoute_id` is specified, this parameter must match the quote's `quote.sell_amount` or be omitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `quote_id`          | string                                  | (optional) The `id` returned from a `SEP-38 POST /quote` response. If this parameter is provided and the user delivers the deposit funds to the Anchor before the quote expiration, the Anchor must respect the conversion rate agreed in that quote. When `quote_id` is set, `asset_code`, `destination_asset` and `amount` must be validated by the anchor, if present. In case of a conflict with the ones used to create the [SEP-38] quote, this request should be rejected with a `400`. |
| `account`           | `G...` or `M...` string                 | (optional) The Stellar or muxed account the client will use as the source of the withdrawal payment to the anchor. Defaults to the account authenticated via SEP-10 if not specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `memo`              | string                                  | (**deprecated**, optional) This field was originally intended to differentiate users of the same Stellar account. However, the anchor should use the `sub` value included in the decoded SEP-10 JWT instead. Anchors should still support this parameter to maintain support for outdated clients. See the [Shared Account Authentication](#shared-omnibus-or-pooled-accounts) section for more information.                                                                                   |
| `memo_type`         | string                                  | (**deprecated**, optional) Type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`. Deprecated because memos used to identify users of the same Stellar account should always be of type of `id`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `wallet_name`       | string                                  | (**deprecated**,optional) In communications / pages about the withdrawal, anchor should display the wallet name to the user to explain where funds are coming from. However, anchors should use client_domain (for non-custodial) and `sub` value of JWT (for custodial) to determine wallet information.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `wallet_url`        | string                                  | (**deprecated**,optional) Anchor can show this to the user when referencing the wallet involved in the withdrawal (ex. in the anchor's transaction history). However, anchors should use client_domain (for non-custodial) and `sub` value of JWT (for custodial) to determine wallet information.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `lang`              | string                                  | (optional) Defaults to `en` if not specified or if the specified language is not supported. Language code specified using [RFC 4646] which means it can also accept locale in the format `en-US`. `error` fields in the response, as well as the interactive flow UI and any other user-facing strings returned for this transaction should be in this language.                                                                                                                               |
| `refund_memo`       | string                                  | (optional) The memo the anchor must use when sending refund payments back to the user. If not specified, the anchor should use the same memo used by the user to send the original payment. If specified, `refund_memo_type` must also be specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `refund_memo_type`  | string                                  | (optional) The type of the `refund_memo`. Can be `id`, `text`, or `hash`. See the [memos](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/encyclopedia/memos) documentation for more information. If specified, `refund_memo` must also be specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `customer_id`       | string                                  | (optional) id of an off-chain account (managed by the anchor) associated with this user's Stellar account (identified by the JWT's `sub` field). If the anchor supports [SEP-12], the `customer_id` field should match the [SEP-12] customer's id. `customer_id` should be passed only when the off-chain id is know to the client, but the relationship between this id and the user's Stellar account is not known to the Anchor.                                                            |

Additionally, any [SEP-9](sep-0009.md) parameters may be passed as well to make the onboarding experience simpler.

Example:

```
POST TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024/transactions/withdraw/interactive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

asset_code=USD&email_address=myaccount@gmail.com&account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI
```

When uploading data for fields specified in [SEP-9](sep-0009.md), `binary` type fields (typically files) should be
submitted **after all other fields**. The reason for this is that some web servers require `binary` fields at the end so
that they know when they can begin processing the request as a stream.

### Response

There are several possible kinds of response, depending on whether the anchor needs more information about the user, how
it should be sent to the anchor, and if there are any errors.

Responses are detailed in the [Deposit and Withdraw shared responses](#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) section
below.

## Deposit and Withdraw shared responses

### Interactive customer information needed

Response code: `200 OK`

An anchor that requires the user to fill out information on a webpage hosted by the anchor should use this response.
This can happen in situations where the anchor needs KYC information about a user, or when the anchor needs the user to
perform a custom step for each transaction like entering an SMS code to confirm a withdrawal or selecting a bank
account. A wallet that receives this response should open a popup browser window or embedded webview to the specified
URL. The anchor must take care that the popup page displays well on a mobile device, as many wallets are phone apps.

As the user is interacting with the anchor popup, they will make progress on their deposit or withdrawal and cause
updates to the transaction status. The wallet must either listen for a callback or poll the
[`/transaction`](#single-historical-transaction) endpoint for updates about the transaction from the anchor. This allows
the wallet to show the user status information and confirm if the deposit attempt initiated successfully or failed. For
withdrawals, the wallet must get information on where to send the withdrawal payment to the anchor.

The response body must be a JSON object with the following fields:

| Name   | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type` | string | Always set to `interactive_customer_info_needed`.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `url`  | string | URL hosted by the anchor. The wallet should show this URL to the user as a popup.                                                                                                                  |
| `id`   | string | The anchor's internal ID for this deposit / withdrawal request. The wallet will use this ID to query the [`/transaction`](#single-historical-transaction) endpoint to check status of the request. |

Example response:

```json
{
  "type": "interactive_customer_info_needed",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/kycflow?account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI",
  "id": "82fhs729f63dh0v4"
}
```

#### Adding parameters to the URL

Before the wallet sends the user to the `url` field received from the anchor, it may add query parameters to the URL.

The basic parameters are summarized in the table below.

| Name                 | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `callback`           | string | (optional) [`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) or a URL that the anchor should `POST` a JSON message to when the user successfully completes the interactive flow. If the callback is a URL (not a `postMessage`), it needs to be signed by the anchor and the signature needs to be verified by the wallet according to the [callback signature specification](#callback-signature). |
| `on_change_callback` | string | (optional) [`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) or a URL that the anchor should `POST` a JSON message to when the `status` or `kyc_verified` properties change. If the callback is a URL (not a `postMessage`), it needs to be signed by the anchor and the signature needs to be verified by the wallet according to the [callback signature specification](#callback-signature).     |

The URL supplied by both callback parameters should receive the full transaction object.

**`callback` details**

If the wallet wants to be notified that the user has completed the anchor's interactive flow (either success or
failure), it can add this parameter to the URL. If the user abandons the process, the anchor does not need to report
anything to the wallet. If the `callback` value is a URL, the anchor must `POST` to it with a JSON message as the body.

**`postMessage` details**

Note that there are some security concerns associated with supporting `postMessage` callbacks. These conerns are
detailed in the section below.

If provided, the anchor must post a JSON message (either as a JSON-serialized string or a plain javascript object) to
`window.opener` via the Javascript
[`Window.postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) method. If `window.opener`
is undefined, the message must be posted to `window.parent` instead.

Because `callback` is used to notify the wallet that the interactive flow is complete, it is common for anchors to make
the `postMessage` callback as a result of the user clicking a "Close" button or similar UI element. The wallet can then
close the window displaying the anchor's interactive flow using
`[Window.close()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/close). This ensures the wallet application
receives the transaction's information and the user has a smooth experience.

**Security Concerns (`noopener`, `postMessage`)**

Wallet applications display content rendered by a third party anchor service. It is recommended to use the
[`rel=noopener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/noopener) attribute on links or the
`noopener` feature for
[`Window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#window_functionality_features).

Note that using `noopener` prohibits the use of `postMessage` callbacks. If `postMessage` callbacks are required for
your implementation, it recommended to only open URLs from anchors that you, the wallet developer, trust.

To validate the provenance and integrity of the callback, anchors [must sign it](#callback-signature) and wallet servers
must validate the signature before taking any action.

**Differences between `callback` and `on_change_callback`**

Anchors may make _at most one request_ containing a `/transaction` response body to `callback` when the user is finished
with the interactive flow.

`on_change_callback` should be called each time the `status` or `kyc_verified` properties of the transaction change. It
can be called any number of times.

**`callback` / `on_change_callback` example**

The JSON message should be identical to the response format for the [/transaction](#single-historical-transaction)
endpoint.

```javascript
// Example callback at the end of an interactive withdraw, indicating that the anchor is waiting for the wallet to send a payment in the amount of 80 of the asset in question.
fetch(callback, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    // a plain javascript object can also be used for postMessage calls
    transaction: {
      id: "anchors_identifier_for_this_transaction",
      status: "pending_user_transfer_start",
      withdraw_anchor_account: "ANCHORS_STELLAR_ACCOUNT_ID",
      withdraw_memo: "MEMO_ANCHOR_EXPECTS_TO_SEE",
      withdraw_memo_type: "text|hash|id",
      amount_in: "80",
      // ... Any other values from the /transaction endpoint can and should be passed as well
    },
  }),
});
```

#### Guidance for anchors: closing the interactive popup

After the user has provided all necessary information to the anchor through the interactive popup (`url`), the anchor
should either close the popup automatically or instruct the user to close it themselves. If the anchor needs to provide
instructions to the user for sending funds to it's off-chain account (in the deposit case), the anchor should not close
the popup until the user has indicated to do so.

When the popup is closed, the transaction's status should no longer be `incomplete`. Instead, it should be one of the
following:

- `pending_anchor` if the anchor must verify KYC information given prior to receiving funds.
- `pending_user` if the user must take some action before sending funds to the anchor.
- `pending_user_transfer_start` if anchor is ready to receive the funds. This is the most common status after
  `incomplete`.
- `pending_user_transfer_complete` if anchor detects the payment is fulfilled and the funds is ready for the user to
  pick up. This is the most common status after `pending_user_transfer_start` if the user must pick up the funds in
  person.
- `pending_trust` if the user does not have a trustline to the asset requested for deposit. Note that a trustline can be
  established after the anchor has received funds. A trustline is not required if both the wallet and anchor support
  [Claimable Balances](#claimable-balances).

#### Guidance for wallets: completing an interactive withdrawal

Given the nature of the interactive withdrawal, the user will interact with the anchor via the popup. They enter
information needed to complete the withdrawal like destination bank account or KYC details. Once the anchor has enough
information to know how to complete the withdrawal, the anchor closes the popup and the wallet allows the user to
complete the withdrawal inside the wallet's app. It has to work this way because the wallet must transfer the correct
amount of the withdrawal asset to the anchor's Stellar account before the anchor can complete its end of the withdrawal.

The wallet needs to wait for the transaction's status to be `pending_user_transfer_start` before sending a payment on
Stellar to the anchor's account. To detect the transaction's status, either poll the `/transaction` endpoint with the
`id` provided in the `/transactions/withdraw/interactive` response from the anchor until the necessary information is
available, or register a callback with the anchor as described above.

When a successful response comes back (either from polling or via callback), the response will contain the transaction
fields described in the [/transactions](#transaction-history) endpoint.

The wallet must use the response fields in the following way to complete the withdrawal:

- `status`: `pending_user_transfer_start` means the user has given all necessary info to the anchor, and it is up to the
  wallet to send the actual stellar assets.
- `status`: `pending_user_transfer_complete` means the Stellar payment has been successfully received by the anchor and
  the off-chain funds are available for the customer to pick up. Instructions to pick up the funds should be provided to
  the customer either through the `more_info_url` url or another method such as email.
- `withdraw_anchor_account`: send the withdrawal payment to this Stellar account.
- `withdraw_memo`: (if specified) use this memo in the payment transaction to the anchor.
- `withdraw_memo_type`: use this as the memo type.
- `amount_in`: the amount expected in the Stellar payment.

The next step is for the wallet to display a confirmation screen summarizing the withdrawal to the user, and then send a
Stellar payment to `withdraw_anchor_account`. The wallet should show the following info to the user:

- `to`: show the user what external account they will be withdrawing to.
- `external_extra_text`: show the bank name or store name that the user will be withdrawing their funds to.
- `more_info_url`: tell the user they can visit this URL for more info about their transaction as it processes.

The anchor may chose to replace most of the digits in the `to` account number with `*`s to keep it confidential.

#### Guidance for wallets: completing an interactive deposit

When a user initiates a deposit, the wallet must kick off a background process to handle the case where the account
[has no trustline](#stellar-account-doesnt-trust-asset).

After that, the wallet displays the anchor's interactive URL in a popup, and everything else the user needs to do to
complete that deposit either happens in the popup, or externally (for example by initiating a SEPA transfer). The wallet
must track the status of the deposit in the same fashion as described in the withdrawal guidance section, and may show
that information to the user.

If the wallet displays information to the user, it can display any of the fields that may be useful to the user, such as
`more_info_url`, `status`, and `amount_in`.

### Authentication required

Response code: `403 Forbidden`

This endpoint requires [authentication](#authentication).

```json
{
  "type": "authentication_required"
}
```

### Error

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. The body should contain a string indicating the error details.
This error is in a human readable format in the language indicated in the request and is intended to be displayed by the
wallet. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```

## Info

Allows an anchor to communicate basic info about what their `TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024` supports to wallets and clients.
If an anchor supports the native asset, the `native` asset code with a `null` asset issuer should be included in the
response.

The `native` asset on the [Stellar Public Network][pubnet] is the [lumen (XLM)][lumen].

[pubnet]: https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/testnet-and-pubnet
[lumen]: https://stellar.org/lumens

### Request

```
GET TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024/info
```

Request parameters:

| Name   | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lang` | string | (optional) Defaults to `en` if not specified or the if the specified language is not supported. Language code specified using [RFC 4646] which means it can also accept locale in the format `en-US`. `description` fields in the response should be in this language. |

### Response

The response should be a JSON object like:

```json
{
  "deposit": {
    "USD": {
      "enabled": true,
      "fee_fixed": 5,
      "fee_percent": 1,
      "min_amount": 0.1,
      "max_amount": 1000
    },
    "ETH": {
      "enabled": true,
      "fee_fixed": 0.002,
      "fee_percent": 0
    },
    "native": {
      "enabled": true,
      "fee_fixed": 0.00001,
      "fee_percent": 0
    }
  },
  "withdraw": {
    "USD": {
      "enabled": true,
      "fee_minimum": 5,
      "fee_percent": 0.5,
      "min_amount": 0.1,
      "max_amount": 1000
    },
    "ETH": {
      "enabled": false
    },
    "native": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "fee": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "features": {
    "account_creation": true,
    "claimable_balances": true
  }
}
```

The JSON object contains an entry for each Stellar asset that the anchor supports for deposit and/or withdrawal.

#### For each deposit asset, response contains:

- `enabled`: `true` if deposit for this asset is supported
- `min_amount`: Optional minimum amount. No limit if not specified.
- `max_amount`: Optional maximum amount. No limit if not specified.
- `fee_fixed`: Optional fixed (base) fee for deposit. In units of the deposited asset. This is in addition to any
  `fee_percent`. Omit if there is no fee or the fee schedule is complex.
- `fee_percent`: Optional percentage fee for deposit. In percentage points. This is in addition to any `fee_fixed`. Omit
  if there is no fee or the fee schedule is complex.
- `fee_minimum`: Optional minimum fee in units of the deposited asset.

#### For each withdrawal asset, response contains:

- `enabled`: `true` if withdrawal for this asset is supported
- `min_amount`: Optional minimum amount. No limit if not specified.
- `max_amount`: Optional maximum amount. No limit if not specified.
- `fee_fixed`: Optional fixed (base) fee for withdraw. In units of the withdrawn asset. This is in addition to any
  `fee_percent`.
- `fee_percent`: Optional percentage fee for withdraw in percentage points. This is in addition to any `fee_fixed`.
- `fee_minimum`: Optional minimum fee in units of the withdrawn asset.

If `fee_fixed` or `fee_percent` are provided, the total fee is calculated as
`(amount * fee_percent) + fee_fixed = fee_total`. If the fee structure doesn't fit this model, omit them and provide the
[`/fee`](#fee) endpoint instead.

An anchor should also indicate in the `/info` response if they support the `fee`endpoint, by providing the following
fields:

- `authentication_required`: `true` if client must be [authenticated](#authentication) before accessing the `fee`
  endpoint.
- `enabled`: `true` if the endpoint is available.

#### Feature Flags

The `features` object contains boolean values indicating whether specific features are supported by the anchor. If the
object or specific feature is not present in the response, the default value described below may be assumed. This
information enables wallets to adjust their behavior based on the feature set supported by the anchor.

| Name                 | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `account_creation`   | `true`  | Whether or not the anchor supports creating accounts for users requesting deposits.                                                                                        |
| `claimable_balances` | `false` | Whether or not the anchor supports sending deposit funds as claimable balances. This is relevant for users of Stellar accounts without a trustline to the requested asset. |

The default values for the features listed above have been selected based on the ecosystem's current support. It is
highly recommend to support all features enumerated for the best user experience.

## Fee

**This endpoint is deprecated. The [SEP-38] `GET /price` endpoint should be used to fetch fees instead.**

The fee endpoint allows an anchor to report the fee that would be charged for a given deposit or withdraw operation.
This is important to allow an anchor to accurately report fees to a user even when the fee schedule is complex. If a fee
can be fully expressed with the `fee_fixed`, `fee_percent` or `fee_minimum` fields in the `/info` response, then an
anchor should not implement this endpoint.

Note that this endpoint does not support providing fees for transactions using non-equivalent on and off-chain assets,
since it only accepts the on-chain `asset_code` request parameter.

```
GET TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024/fee
```

Request parameters:

| Name         | Type   | Description                                                                        |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operation`  | string | Kind of operation (`deposit` or `withdraw`).                                       |
| `type`       | string | (optional) Type of deposit or withdrawal (`SEPA`, `bank_account`, `cash`, etc...). |
| `asset_code` | string | Asset code.                                                                        |
| `amount`     | float  | Amount of the asset that will be deposited/withdrawn.                              |

Example request:

```
GET https://api.example.com/fee?operation=withdraw&asset_code=ETH&amount=0.5
```

On success the endpoint should return `200 OK` HTTP status code and a JSON object with the following fields:

| Name  | Type  | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fee` | float | The total fee (in units of the asset involved) that would be charged to deposit/withdraw the specified `amount` of `asset_code`. |

Example response:

```json
{
  "fee": 0.013
}
```

Every HTTP status code other than `200 OK` will be considered an error. The body should contain error details. For
example:

```json
{
  "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```

## Transaction History

The transaction history endpoint helps anchors enable a better experience for users using an external wallet. With it,
wallets can display the status of deposits and withdrawals while they process and a history of past transactions with
the anchor. It's only for transactions that are deposits to or withdrawals from the anchor. It returns a list of
transactions from the account encoded in the authenticated JWT.

If the decoded JWT's `sub` parameter also contains a memo, the anchor must only return transactions for the user
identified by a combination of the account and memo. The anchor must not return all transactions for the Stellar account
because that would include transactions for other memos.

| `to`                      | string | Sent to address (perhaps BTC, IBAN, or bank account in the case of a withdrawal, Stellar address in the case of a deposit).                                           |

`status` should be one of:

- `incomplete` -- there is not yet enough information for this transaction to be initiated. Perhaps the user has not yet
  entered necessary info in an interactive flow.
- `pending_user_transfer_start` -- the user has not yet initiated their transfer to the anchor. This is the next
  necessary step in any deposit or withdrawal flow after transitioning from `incomplete`.
- `pending_user_transfer_complete` -- the Stellar payment has been successfully received by the anchor and the off-chain
  funds are available for the customer to pick up. Only used for withdrawal transactions.
- `pending_external` -- deposit/withdrawal has been submitted to external network, but is not yet confirmed. This is the
  status when waiting on Bitcoin or other external crypto network to complete a transaction, or when waiting on a bank
  transfer.
- `pending_anchor` -- deposit/withdrawal is being processed internally by anchor. This can also be used when the anchor
  must verify KYC information prior to deposit/withdrawal.
- `on_hold` -- deposit/withdrawal is currently on hold for additional checks after receiving user's funds. Anchor may
  use this status to indicate to the user that transaction is being reviewed (for example, for compliance reasons). Once
  this status cleared, transaction should follow the regular flow.
- `pending_stellar` -- deposit/withdrawal operation has been submitted to Stellar network, but is not yet confirmed.
- `pending_trust` -- the user must add a trustline for the asset for the deposit to complete.
- `pending_user` -- the user must take additional action before the deposit / withdrawal can complete, for example an
  email or 2fa confirmation of a withdraw.
- `completed` -- deposit/withdrawal fully completed.
- `refunded` -- the deposit/withdrawal is fully refunded.
- `expired` -- funds were never received by the anchor and the transaction is considered abandoned by the user. If a
  SEP-38 quote was specified when the transaction was initiated, the transaction should expire when the quote expires,
  otherwise anchors are responsible for determining when transactions are considered expired.
- `no_market` -- could not complete deposit because no satisfactory asset/XLM market was available to create the
  account.
- `too_small` -- deposit/withdrawal size less than `min_amount`.
- `too_large` -- deposit/withdrawal size exceeded `max_amount`.
- `error` -- catch-all for any error not enumerated above.

| `amount`      | string | The amount of asset applied. If `fee_details.breakdown` is provided, `sum(fee_details.breakdown.amount)` should be equals `fee_details.total`. |

### Amount Formulas

The following should hold true for all transaction records, assuming `amount_in_asset` and `amount_out_asset` are the
same. If they are different, the following should still hold true after converting all amounts to units of one of the
assets.

```
amount_out = amount_in - amount_fee - refunds.amount_refunded - refunds.amount_fee
```

```
refunds.amount_refunded = sum(refunds.payments[].amount)
```

```
refunds.amount_fee = sum(refunds.payments[].fee)
```

```

Every HTTP status code other than `200 OK` will be considered an error. An empty transaction list is _not_ an error. The
body should contain error details. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```

## Single Historical Transaction

The transaction endpoint enables clients to query/validate a specific transaction at an anchor.

Anchors must ensure that the SEP-10 JWT included in the request contains the Stellar account and optional memo value
used when making the original deposit or withdraw request that resulted in the transaction requested using this
endpoint.

```
GET TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024/transaction
```

Request parameters:

| Name                      | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                      | string            | (optional) The id of the transaction.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `stellar_transaction_id`  | (optional) string | The stellar transaction id of the transaction.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `external_transaction_id` | (optional) string | The external transaction id of the transaction.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `lang`                    | string            | (optional) Defaults to `en` if not specified or if the specified language is not supported. Language code specified using [RFC 4646] which means it can also accept locale in the format `en-US`. |

One of `id`, `stellar_transaction_id` or `external_transaction_id` is required.

On success the endpoint should return `200 OK` HTTP status code and a JSON object with the following fields:

| Name          | Type   | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `transaction` | object | The transaction that was requested by the client. |

The `transaction` object should be of the same form as the objects returned by the
`TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024/transactions` endpoint.

Example response:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "id": "82fhs729f63dh0v4",
    "kind": "deposit",
    "status": "pending_external",
    "status_eta": 3600,
    "external_transaction_id": "2dd16cb409513026fbe7defc0c6f826c2d2c65c3da993f747d09bf7dafd31093",
    "more_info_url": "https://youranchor.com/tx/242523523",
    "amount_in": "18.34",
    "amount_out": "18.24",
    "amount_fee": "0.1",
    "started_at": "2017-03-20T17:05:32Z",
    "claimable_balance_id": "00000000c2d8c89264288dbde8488364fd3fd30850fd4e7fbf6d1e9809702558afa4fdea"
  }
}
```

If the transaction cannot be found, the endpoint should return a `404 NOT FOUND` result.

Every HTTP status code other than `200 OK` will be considered an error. An empty transaction list is _not_ an error. The
body should contain error details. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```

## Changes from SEP-6

There is a small set of changes when upgrading from SEP-6 to SEP-24.

1. SEP-24 now requires authentication on all endpoints. The `authentication_required` flag is removed from the `/info`
   endpoint since authentication is assumed.
1. `GET /deposit` and `GET /withdraw` have been replaced with [`POST /transactions/deposit/interactive`](#deposit) and
   [`POST /transactions/withdraw/interactive`](#withdraw). This is for security purposes to keep submitted personally
   identifiable information out of URL query parameters. Instead of passing data through query parameters, it's now
   expected through `multipart/form-data` POST requests.
1. Remove the `type` parameter from the `/deposit` and `/withdraw` endpoints as this is information collected in the
   interactive flow.
1. Removed the `fields` and `types` definitions from the `/info` endpoint. Instead of trying to communicate to the
   wallet what fields an anchor wishes for the wallet to collect and send, the wallet can send any fields it wishes to
   share for a better UX (such as `email_address`), and anything not sent should be collected by the anchor. If none of
   these fields are sent, the anchor should still be able to continue and collect these fields during the interative
   flow.
1. Removed `external_extra` transaction property since this should all live in a human readable ` more_info_url`.
1. Changed the response of the deposit and withdraw endpoints from 403 to 200 since this is the expected flow.
1. `/transactions` and `/transaction` are now required endpoints.
1. It is now recommended to use a short-lived, one-time JWT in the context of the interactive webapp.

- Anchors should not accept JWT's that have expired or been used before.

1. `/transactions` endpoint no longer accepts an `account` query. The account is pulled from the JWT.
