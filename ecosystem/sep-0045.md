## Simple Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for clients such as wallets or exchanges to create authenticated web sessions on
behalf of a user who holds a contract account. A wallet may want to authenticate with any web service which requires a
contract account ownership verification, for example, to upload KYC information to an anchor in an authenticated way as
described in [SEP-12](sep-0012.md).

This SEP is based on [SEP-10](sep-0010.md), but does not replace it. This SEP only supports `C` (contract) accounts.
SEP-10 only support `G` and `M` accounts. Services wishing to support all accounts should implement both SEPs.

## Definitions

- **Address**: An identifier representing a possible account on the Stellar network. Addresses begin with specific
  prefixes like G for public keys (accounts controlled by secret keys), M for muxed accounts and C for contract
  accounts.
- **Account**: A stateful entity on the Stellar network that can hold balances. This can refer to a Stellar account
  (`G...` address, or the `G...` base address of an `M...` address) or Soroban contract that abstracts an account
  (`C...` addresses).

## Abstract

This protocol is a variation of mutual challenge-response, which uses Stellar authorization entries to encode challenges
and responses.

It involves the following components:

- A **Home Domain**: a domain hosting a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) containing a `WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT`
  (URL), `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID`, and `SIGNING_KEY` (`G...`).
- A **Server**: a server providing the `WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT` that implements the GET and POST operations
  discussed in this document. The server's domain may be the **Home Domain**, a sub-domain of the **Home Domain**, or a
  different domain.
  - The `SIGNING_KEY` from this domain is referred to as the **Server Account** in this document.
- A **Client Account**: the account being authenticated.
  - A Stellar contract account (`C...`).
- A **Client**: the software used by the holder of the **Client Account** being authenticated by the **Server**.
- A **Client Domain** (optional): a domain hosting a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) containing a `SIGNING_KEY` used
  for [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain)
  - The `SIGNING_KEY` from this domain is referred to as the **Client Domain Account** in this document.
- A **Web Auth Contract**: a contract that implements the `web_auth_verify` function as described in this document. The
  contract must be deployed at the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` address specified in the **Server**'s `stellar.toml`.

The discovery flow is as follows:

1. The **Client** retrieves the `stellar.toml` from the **Home Domain** in accordance with
   [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md).
1. The **Client** looks up the `WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT`, `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` and `SIGNING_KEY` (i.e.
   **Server Account**) from the `stellar.toml`.

The authentication flow is as follows:

1. The **Client** requests a unique [`challenge`](#challenge) from the **Server** which includes a list of authorization
   entries XDR-encoded strings
1. If the request contains a `client_domain` parameter, the **Server** may fetch the **Client Domain Account** and
   generate the challenge with an additional authorization entry as described in the [Response](#response) section.
1. The **Server** responds with the challenge
1. The **Client** verifies that each authorization entry does not contain any sub-invocations
1. The **Client** verifies that the `contract_address` in each authorization entry matches the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID`
   from the **Server**'s `stellar.toml`
1. The **Client** verifies that the `function_name` in each authorization entry is `web_auth_verify`
1. The **Client** verifies that the `args` map in each authorization entry match the expected values and is the same
   across all authorization entries:
   1. The `account` value matches the **Client Account** address
   1. The `home_domain` value matches the **Home Domain**
   1. The `web_auth_domain` value matches the **Server**'s domain
   1. The `web_auth_domain_account` value matches the **Server Account**
   1. If the **Client** included a `client_domain` in the request:
      1. The `client_domain` value matches the **Client**'s domain
      1. The `client_domain_account` value matches the **Client Domain Account**
1. The **Client** verifies that there is an authorization entry where `credentials.address.address` is the **Server
   Account** and contains a valid signature from the **Server Account**
1. The **Client** signs the authorization entry where `credentials.address.address` is the **Client Account** using the
   secret key(s) of the signer(s) for the **Client Account**
   - Note: **Client** signatures may not be required if the **Client** contract's `__check_auth` implementation does not
     require them
1. The **Client** obtains a signature from the **Client Domain Account** for the authorization entry where
   `credentials.address.address` is the **Client Domain Account** if the **Client** included a client domain in the
   request
1. The **Client** simulates the transaction with the signed authorization entries and verifies the following to ensure
   the transaction does not have any unintended side effects:
   - The transaction's ledger footprint `read_write` set contains only `contract_data` entries where:
     - The `contract` is the **Client Account** address, and the `key` is `ledger_key_nonce`.
     - The `contract` is the **Server Account**, and the `key` is `ledger_key_nonce`.
     - (Optional) if an authorization entry for the **Client Domain Account** was present in the challenge, the
       `contract` is the **Client Domain Account**, and the `key` is `ledger_key_nonce`.
1. The **Client** submits the signed authorization entries back to the **Server** using [`token`](#token) endpoint
1. The **Server** extracts the arguments from the authorization entries returned by the client
1. The **Server** verifies that the `contract_address` in each authorization entry matches the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID`
   from the **Server**'s `stellar.toml`
1. The **Server** verifies that the `function_name` in each authorization entry is `web_auth_verify`
1. The **Server** verifies that the `args` map in each authorization entry match the expected values and are the same
   across all authorization entries:
   1. The `account` value matches the **Client Account** address
   1. The `home_domain` value matches the **Home Domain**
   1. The `web_auth_domain` value matches the **Server**'s domain
   1. The `web_auth_domain_account` value matches the **Server Account**
   1. The `client_domain_account` value matches the **Client Domain Account** if the **Client** included a
      `client_domain` in the request, otherwise it is not present
1. The **Server** verifies that the `nonce` argument is the same across all authorization entries and is unique
1. The **Server** verifies that there is an authorization entry where `credentials.address.address` is the **Server
   Account** and contains a valid signature from the **Server Account**
1. The **Server** verifies that there is an authorization entry where `credentials.address.address` is the **Client
   Account** address
1. The **Server** verifies that there is an authorization entry where `credentials.address.address` is the **Client
   Domain Address** if the arguments included a `client_domain_address`
1. The **Server** constructs a transaction with a single Invoke Host Function operation where the contract address is
   `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` and the function is `web_auth_verify` using the previously extracted arguments and the
   authorization entries returned by the client
1. If the simulation succeeds, the **Server** responds with a [JWT](https://jwt.io) that represents the authenticated
   session

The flow achieves several things:

- Both **Client** and **Server** can be implemented using well-established Stellar libraries
- The **Client** can verify that the **Server** holds the secret key to the **Server Account**
- The **Server** can verify that the **Client** is authorized by the contract account to create an authenticated session
- The **Server** can choose its own timeout for the authenticated session
- The **Server** can choose to include other application-specific claims

## Authentication Endpoint

The organization with a **Home Domain** indicates that it supports authentication via this protocol by specifying
`WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md) file. This is how a wallet knows where to find
the **Server**. A **Server** is required to implement the following behavior for the web authentication endpoint:

- [`GET <WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT>`](#challenge): request a challenge (step 1)
- [`POST <WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT>`](#token): exchange a signed challenge for session JWT (step 2)

## Cross-Origin Headers

Valid CORS headers are necessary to allow web clients from other sites to use the endpoints. The following HTTP header
must be set for all authentication endpoints, including error responses.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

In order for browsers-based wallets to validate the CORS headers, as
[specified by W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request), the preflight request (OPTIONS request) must be
implemented in all the endpoints that support Cross-Origin.

### Challenge

This endpoint must respond with authorization entries to be signed by the **Client**. The **Client** signs the entries
using standard Stellar libraries and submit it to [`token`](#token) endpoint to prove that it controls the **Client
Account**. This approach is compatible with hardware wallets such as Ledger. The **Client Application** must also verify
the server's signature to be sure the challenge is signed by the **Server Account**, that the home domain argument in
the function invocation is the **Home Domain**, and that the web auth domain argument in the function invocation is the
**Server** domain.

#### Request

```
GET <WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT>
```

##### Request Parameters:

| Name            | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `account`       | `C...` string | The **Client Account** address (`C...`) that the **Client** wishes to authenticate with the **Server**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `home_domain`   | string        | A **Home Domain**. Servers that generate tokens for multiple **Home Domain**s can use this parameter to identify which home domain the **Client** hopes to authenticate with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `client_domain` | string        | (optional) a **Client Domain**. Supplied by **Clients** that intend to verify their domain in addition to the **Client Account**. See [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain). **Servers** should ignore this parameter if the **Server** does not support **Client Domain** verification, or the **Server** does not support verification for the specific **Client Domain** included in the request. |

Example:

```
GET https://auth.example.com/?account=CCIBUCGPOHWMMMFPFTDWBSVHQRT4DIBJ7AD6BZJYDITBK2LCVBYW7HUQ&home_domain=example.com
```

#### Response

##### Success

On success the endpoint must return `200 OK` HTTP status code and a JSON object with the following fields:

- `authorization_entries`: an XDR-encoded array of `SorobanAuthorizationEntry`s. It contains an entry for the **Client
  Account** in addition to a signed entry from the **Server Account** and optionally the **Client Domain Account**. The
  entries are not guaranteed to be in any specific order.

Each entry's `root_invocation` function is a `contract_fn` with no sub-invocations and the following values:

- `contract_address` is the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` from the **Server**'s `stellar.toml`
- `function_name` is `web_auth_verify`
- An `args` map containing the following Symbol to String pairs:
  - `account` matches the `account` from the request
  - `home_domain` matches the `home_domain` from the request
  - `web_auth_domain` matches the **Server**'s domain
  - `web_auth_domain_account` matches the **Server Account**
  - `client_domain` matches the **Client**'s domain if the **Client** included a `client_domain` in the request and the
    server supports [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain)
  - `client_domain_account` matches the **Client Domain Account** if the **Client** included a `client_domain` in the
    request and the server supports [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain)
  - `nonce` is a unique value that is the same across all authorization entries
- `network_passphrase`: (optional but recommended) Stellar network passphrase used by the **Server**. This allows a
  **Client** to verify that it's using the correct passphrase when signing and is useful for identifying when a
  **Client** or **Server** have been configured incorrectly.

##### Error

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "The provided account has requested too many challenges recently. Try again later."
}
```

### Token

This endpoint accepts a signed challenge transaction, validates it and responds with a session
[JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) authenticating the account.

The **Client** submits a challenge (that was previously returned by the [`challenge`](#challenge) endpoint) as a HTTP
POST request to `WEB_AUTH_FOR_CONTRACTS_ENDPOINT` using one of the following formats (both should be equally supported
by the server):

- Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, body: `authorization_entries=<XDR (URL-encoded)>`)
- Content-Type: `application/json`, body: `{"authorization_entries": "<XDR>""}`

To validate the challenge transaction the following steps are performed by the **Server**. If any of the listed steps
fail, then the authentication request must be rejected — that is, treated by the **Server** as an invalid input.

1. Extract the arguments from the authorization entries returned by the client;
1. Verify that the `contract_address` in each authorization entry matches the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` from the
   **Server**'s `stellar.toml`;
1. Verify that the `function_name` in each authorization entry is `web_auth_verify`;
1. Verify that the `args` in each authorization entry match the expected values and is the same across all authorization
   entries:
   1. The `home_domain` value matches the **Home Domain**;
   1. The `web_auth_domain` value matches the **Server**'s domain;
   1. The `web_auth_domain_account` value matches the **Server Account**;
   1. The `client_domain` is present if `client_domain_address` is present;
   1. The `client_domain_account` value matches the **Client Domain Account** if `client_domain` is present;
1. Verify that the `nonce` argument is the same across all authorization entries and is valid;
1. Verify that there is an authorization entry where `credentials.address.address` is the **Server Account** and
   contains a valid signature from the **Server Account**;
1. Verify that there is an authorization entry where `credentials.address.address` is the **Client Account** address
1. Verify that there is an authorization entry where `credentials.address.address` is the **Client Domain Account** if
   the arguments included a `client_domain_account`.
1. Construct a transaction with a single Invoke Host Function operation where the contract address is
   `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` and the function is `web_auth_verify` using the previously extracted arguments and the
   authorization entries returned by the client;
1. Simulate the transaction and verify that it succeeds.

The verification process confirms that the **Client** controls the **Client Account** and that the challenge was not
tampered with. Depending on your application this may mean complete signing authority, some threshold of control, or
being a signer of the account. See [Verification](#verification) for examples.

Upon successful verification, **Server** responds with a session JWT, containing the following claims:

- `iss` (the principal that issued a token, [RFC7519, Section 4.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1))
  — a [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)] for the issuer (`https://example.com` or `https://example.com/G...`)
- `sub` (the principal that is the subject of the JWT,
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)) — the **Client Account**'s address
  (`C...`).
- `iat` (the time at which the JWT was issued
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6)) — current timestamp (`1530644093`)
- `exp` (the expiration time on or after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing,
  [RFC7519, Section 4.1.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)) — a server can pick its own expiration
  period for the token (`1530730493`)
- `client_domain` - (optional) a nonstandard JWT claim containing the client home domain, included if the challenge
  transaction contained a `client_domain` (see [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain))

The JWT may contain other claims specific to your application, see [RFC7519].

The **Server** should not provide more than one JWT for a specific challenge transaction.

#### Response

If the **Server** successfully validates the submitted challenge transaction, the endpoint should return `200 OK` HTTP
status code and a JSON object with the following fields:

| Name    | Type   | Description                                                                    |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `token` | string | The JWT that can be used to authenticate future endpoint calls with the anchor |

Example:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJsb2NhbGhvc3Q6ODA4MCIsInN1YiI6IkNDTEhCVVJZTzRCMkpGVTRZQlpVUVpLSlEyWjM3MjNEUFhUV1U2WURQWE40VFozS0hWUTdOT1VMIiwiaWF0IjoxNzM3MTQyMjI0LCJleHAiOjE3MzcxNDI1MjQsImp0aSI6IjI2MWQ3ZjAyMzljOTMxMDVmMmU1NGJjMWZkYzk2OGY5ZTY4MTUyOTQ1MjljMjQwZDgxMzgwY2U3MGQyYzUyMjAiLCJob21lX2RvbWFpbiI6ImxvY2FsaG9zdDo4MDgwIn0.WrtL94Erny9DpfXehA0dfnpmNvDPPuh3_0oxAT16xuw"

## Web Authentication Contract

The **Server** must deploy a contract at the `WEB_AUTH_CONTRACT_ID` address specified in the **Server**'s
`stellar.toml`. This contract allows the **Server** to customize authentication logic, including client domain
verification and nonce handling.

The contract must implement the `web_auth_verify` function with the following signature. Within this function, the
contract should call `require_auth` on the address to ensure the client has authorized the operation, and call
`require_auth` on the **Server Account** so that the **Server** can verify that the challenge has not been tampered.

If the **Server** supports client domain verification, the contract can optionally call `require_auth` on the client
domain address. All other arguments are ignored by the contract.

The server should include a `nonce` in the `web_auth_verify` function arguments. The `nonce` is a random string
generated by the **Server** and included in the challenge transaction. The `nonce` is verified when the **Client**
submits signed challenge to the **Server**. The `nonce` is used to prevent replay attacks.

Below is an example implementation of the `web_auth_verify` function in Rust:

```rust
#[contracterror]
pub enum WebAuthError {
    MissingArgument = 1,
}

#[contractimpl]
impl WebAuthContract {
    pub fn __constructor(env: Env, admin: Address) -> () {
        env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Admin, &admin);
    }

    /// Verifies the client is authorized to authenticate with the server
    ///
    /// Arguments:
    /// - account: The client account address
    /// - home_domain: The home domain
    /// - web_auth_domain: The server's domain
    /// - web_auth_domain_account: The server's SIGNING_KEY
    /// - client_domain: The client domain (optional)
    /// - client_domain_account: The client domain's SIGNING_KEY (optional)
    /// - nonce: A random string generated by the server to prevent replay attacks
    pub fn web_auth_verify(env: Env, args: Map<Symbol, String>) -> Result<(), WebAuthError> {
        if let Some(address) = args.get(Symbol::new(&env, "account")) {
            let addr = Address::from_string(&address);
            addr.require_auth();
        } else {
            return Err(WebAuthError::MissingArgument);
        }

        if let Some(web_auth_domain_account) = args.get(Symbol::new(&env, "web_auth_domain_account")) {
            let addr = Address::from_string(&web_auth_domain_account);
            addr.require_auth();
        } else {
            return Err(WebAuthError::MissingArgument);
        }

        // Optional client domain verification
        if let Some(client_domain_account) = args.get(Symbol::new(&env, "client_domain_account")) {
            let addr = Address::from_string(&client_domain_account);
            addr.require_auth();
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Replay Prevention

A replay attack is when an attacker uses a previously signed challenge to impersonate a **Client** after the original
authentication was completed. Both the **Server** and the **Client** share responsibility for preventing replay attacks.
Using only one of these approaches described below is insufficient to protect against replay attacks; both must be
implemented together for complete protection.

### Nonce Verification

The **Server** must provide a nonce for each challenge request. The nonce should be a unique value, even for the
identical requests. The **Server** should verify that the nonce is present in the signed challenge and has not been used
before. This ensures that a signed challenge can only be used once. Additionally, the **Server** should reject any
[token](#token) requests that include a nonce that is too old. This limits the time window an attack can use a signed
challenge if intercepted or stolen.

Storing and verifying all nonces for uniqueness might not be practical for every implementation. Therefore, servers
should not depend solely on nonce verification.

### Setting Signature Expiration Ledger

- **Client Side:** The **Client** should set the signature expiration ledger to a near-future ledger (for example, the
  current ledger plus 1). This limits the window in which a signature can be reused.
- **Server Side:** The **Server** should either:
  - Use its own signature expiration ledger on its challenge signature to restrict its validity, and/or
  - Reject client signatures that use a signature expiration ledger that it deems too old.

In summary, even though nonces are always included in challenge requests to ensure signature uniqueness, both the
**Server** and the **Client** must, at a minimum, enforce signature expiration ledgers to effectively narrow the replay
window.

## Verification

### Verifying the Client Domain

A web service requiring SEP-45 authentication may want to attribute each HTTP request made to it to a specific
**Client** software. For example, a web service may want to offer reduced fees for the users of a specific **Client**.

In order to use this optional feature, the organization that provides the **Client** must host a
[SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) file containing a `SIGNING_KEY` attribute (i.e. the **Client Domain Account**). The
`SIGNING_KEY` attribute must be a Stellar public key in the form of a `G` address. The secret key paired with the
`SIGNING_KEY` should be protected as anyone in possession of the secret can verify the **Client Domain**.

This setup allows the **Server** to verify that the challenge returned by the **Client** is also signed by the **Client
Domain Address**, proving that the **Client** is associated with the **Client Domain**. Web services requiring SEP-45
authentication can now attribute requests made with the resulting JWT to the **Client Domain** that signed the
challenge.

**Servers** may chose which **Client Domains** to verify. If the **Client** requests verification of its domain but the
**Server** has no use for verifying that domain, the **Server** should proceed as if the **Client** did not provide the
domain in the request for the challenge transaction. If the **Server** attempts but is unable to fetch the `SIGNING_KEY`
from the provided **Client Domain**, the **Server** should return a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code.

## JWT Expiration

Servers should select an expiration time for the JWT that is appropriate for the assumptions and risk of the
interactions the **Client** can perform with it. A **Client** may be in control of an account at the time the JWT is
issued but they may lose control of the account through a change in signers. Expiration times that are too long increase
the risk that control on the account has changed. Expiration times that are too short increase the number of times
authentication must reoccur, and a user using a hardware signing device or who must complete a complex signing process
could have a poor user experience.

## A convention for signatures

Signatures in Stellar involve both the secret key of the signer and the passphrase of the network. SEP-45 clients and
servers must use the following convention when deciding what network passphrase to use for signing and verifying
signatures in SEP-45:

- If the server is for testing purposes or interacts with the Stellar testnet, use the Stellar testnet passphrase.
- Otherwise, use the Stellar pubnet passphrase.

This convention ensures that SEP-45 clients and servers can use the same passphrase as they're using for interacting
with the Stellar network.

The client can examine the `network_passphrase` (if defined) that the server includes in its response from the challenge
endpoint to be sure it's using the correct passphrase and is connecting to the server that it expected.

## JWT best practices

When generating and validating JWTs it's important to follow best practices. The IETF is in the process of producing a
set of best current practices when using JWTs: [IETF JWT BCP].
