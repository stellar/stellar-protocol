## Summary

This protocol defines an API that enables an individual (e.g., a user or wallet) to regain access to a Stellar account that it owns after the individual has lost its private key without providing any third party control of the account. Using this protocol, the user or wallet will preregister the account and a phone number or email with two or more servers implementing the protocol and add those servers as signers of the account. No individual server will have control of the account, but collectively, they may help the individual recover access to the account. The protocol also enables individuals to pass control of a Stellar account to another individual.

## Motivation

The ability for users to gain access to a Stellar account using credentials
other than the account keys is a critical feature of wallets that support the following use cases for a user:
1. Recover – Recover access to Stellar accounts for which they may have lost keys.
2. Share – Gain access to Stellar accounts that another user intends to share with them.

Solutions exist for wallets to store keys for users and to allow users to retrieve those keys, such as the [keystore] service, but those solutions usually prevent the server from controlling the account by requiring the user to remember an encryption password that, if forgotten, means permanent loss of the account. Those solutions also don't typically support sharing accounts.

The user experience is improved if gaining access to a Stellar account does not require remembering a password.

## Abstract

This protocol defines an API allowing a client to register an account with a
server, and later ask the server to sign transactions for the account.

The registration flow is as follows:
- The client uses [SEP-10] to get a [JWT] proving high threshold control of an account.
- The client, authenticated as the account, registers with the server, providing:
  - One or more identities of individuals that can request the server sign transactions for the account, and for each identity:
    - The identities role in the client's [use case].
    - The authentication methods that can be used to authenticate as this identity:
      - One or more other Stellar addresses.
      - And/or, one or more phone numbers.
      - And/or, one or more email addresses.
- The server verifies the [JWT] is valid according to [SEP-10].
- The server verifies that the account the [JWT] proves control of is the account being registered.
- The server verifies that the account is not already registered.
- The server stores the account address and alternative identities.
- The server generates a unique random signing key for the account.
- The server encrypts the signing secret key and stores it.
- The server responds to the client with the signing public key.
- The client adds the signing public key as a signer of the account with an appropriate weight.

A client can register with multiple servers and give each signing key a weight that is appropriate for the use case the client and servers are targeting. As an example, if a client is intending to use two servers that should individually have no control of the account but together are able to approve transactions, then the client can configure [account thresholds] to high 20, med 20, low 20, and assign weights 10 to both server signing keys.

The signing flow is as follows:
- The client uses the servers phone or email authentication provider to get a [JWT] proving possession of the phone number or email address.
- Alternatively, the client uses [SEP-10] to get a [JWT] proving high threshold control of another account that is listed as an alternative identity of the account to be accessed.
- The client, authenticated as the phone, email, or another account, requests the server to sign a transaction.
- The server verifies that the [JWT] is valid according to the authentication provider's specification.
- The server verifies that the phone, email, or account in the [JWT] is an alternative identity of the account.
- The server verifies that the source account of the transaction is the account.
- The server verifies that the source account of all operations on the transaction are not set or set to the account.
- The server signs the transaction with the signing secret key.
- The server responds to the client with the signature.

The client repeats the signing flow with each server it needs to meet the
accounts threshold to be able to successfully submit a transaction.

The client can use this process to sign a transaction with the [Set Options
operation] to add a new signer to the account to regain control of an account
of which they have lost the key, or to gain control of an account shared with
them.

A client can also use the endpoints in the specification to:
- Discover registered accounts that it has access to.
- Update the identities associated with an account.
- Delete accounts.

## Use Cases

This protocol is intended to satisfy a wide range of use cases, but initially
the two use cases mentioned under [Motivation] are apparent.

### Use Case: Recover
An individual that expects to maybe lose access to their keys can use SEP-30 to
recover access to their Stellar accounts.

A single identity is sufficient and specifying a role would be unnecessary. The
individual registers the account with two or more servers and gives each server
signer weights so that no individual server can control the account, but
together they can approve transactions.

The individual can recover the account by authenticating with all servers and
requesting all servers sign a transaction giving a new key signing weight
sufficient to meet the high threshold of the account.

### Use Case: Share
An individual that wishes to share an account with another user and allow that
other user to gain access to the account by recovering it from two or more
servers.

Multiple identities should be specified each with a unique role so that when
each individual is authenticated using an identities authentication methods
they can recognize their role in relation to the account. In this case using
roles such as `sender` and `receiver` are appropriate.

Either individual can recover the account by authenticating with all servers and
asking all servers to sign a transaction giving a new key signing weight
sufficient to meet the high threshold of the account.

The receiver can accept the account and either take ownership of it or merge it
into another account by authenticating with all servers and requesting all
servers sign a transaction giving a new key signing weight sufficient to meet
the high threshold of the account. The receiver can then merge the account into
their primary account. If the receiver chooses to keep the account they can
delete the account from the servers or replace the identities so that the
sender is no longer an identity authorized to recover the account.

The sender may wish to recover the account if the receiver does not and can use
the same process.

The sender and receiver can recognize their relationship to an account by
inspecting the authenticated identities role.

## Specification

### Authentication

All endpoints require authentication in the form of a [JWT] token that is passed
in the `Authorization` header. The [JWT] can be issued by two types of issuers.
Some endpoints require a specific provider while others should function with
either. The two issuers are:

- `SEP-10`: A [SEP-10] Web Auth server for proving high threshold control of an
account. The [SEP-10] server should be configured to only issue [JWT]s if signers
prove they meet the high threshold on the account.
- `External`: Defined by the implementer. Proves control of a phone number,
email address, or other identity.

### Content Type

All endpoints accept in requests the following `Content-Type`s:
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `application/json`

All endpoints respond with content type:
- `application/json`

### Errors

If an error occurs when calling any endpoint, an appropriate HTTP status code
will be returned along with an error response.

#### Status Code

Common HTTP status codes may be returned for a server. In particular the following are expected:

Status Code | Name | Reason
-----|------|------------
`400` | Bad Request | The request is invalid in anyway.
`401` | Unauthorized | No `Authorization` header has been provided or the contents of the header are not accepted as valid.
`404` | Not Found | The path is not recognized by the server, or the address does not have an account, or the authenticated user does not have permission to access the account.
`409` | Conflict | The account is already registered, when attempting to register an account that is already registered.

#### Response

##### Fields

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`error` | string | A description of the error.

##### Example

```json
{
   "error": "..."
}
```

### Common Fields

A set of common fields are used to describe an account in requests and responses on most endpoints.

#### Common Request Fields

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`identities` | array | A list of identities that if any one is authenticated will be able to gain control of this account.
`identities[].role` | string | The role of the identity. This value is not used by the server and is stored and echoed back in responses as a way for a client to know conceptually who each identity represents.
`identities[].auth_methods` | array | A list of authentication methods that can be used to authenticate as this identity.
`identities[].auth_methods[].type` | string | The type of identity: `stellar_address`, `phone_number`, or `email`.
`identities[].auth_methods[].value` | string | The identity that if authenticated will be given full permissions of the account, either another stellar address, phone number or email address respectively given the type. When encoding a phone number the ITU-T recommendations [E.123] and [E.164] should be followed. The phone number should be formatted in international notation with a leading `+` as demonstrated in E.123 Section 2.5 to ensure phone numbers are consistently encoded and are globally unique. Spaces should be omitted.

```

#### `POST /accounts/<address>/sign`

This endpoint signs a transaction that has operations for the account.

The transaction must only contain operations for the account. The source
account of the transaction and the source account of all operations in the
transaction must match the account in the request.

The transaction can contain any operations, but it is anticipated for the use
cases discussed earlier in this protocol that the transaction will contain an
operation to add a new signer to the account and possibly to remove an old
signer or to merge an account. The signature will be generated using the
signing key that the server generated during registration for the account.

##### Authentication
[`SEP-10`] or [`External`].

##### Request

###### Fields

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`transaction` | string | A XDR base64 encoded Stellar transaction.

## Security Concerns

Building, hosting and using this system has numerous security concerns because
a server is being delegated to be a signer of an account and will handle one or
more signing keys for many accounts. Implementers should also consider [JWT],
encryption, secure coding, and general security best practices.

Implementers and users of the protocol must consider the risks of relying on
alternative identities such as phone number or email to be definite proof of
the identity of a client or user.

This list of concerns is not exhaustive.

## Limitations

This protocol discusses a phone and email authentication provider vaguely but
does not provide any specifics to that specification. This is an area still
under research and once a better definition for what the specification is it
will either be added to this protocol, added as a separate protocol proposal,
or referenced if it is already captured as a standard elsewhere.
