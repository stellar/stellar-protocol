## Simple Summary

Defines common namespaces and fields for account data entries used to
identify and describe NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the issuing account.

## Abstract

This SEP defines data entries that a Stellar account issuing a single asset
that is an NFT can define on itself to describe the NFT it is issuing without
needing to rely on a home domain hosting a stellar.toml containing asset
information about the NFT.

## Motivation

NFTs have become popular over the recent months and there has been an uptick
in experimentation with NFTs on Stellar.

An analysis of account data entries on the Stellar testnet and pubnet
indicates that there is a common approach to the issuing of NFTs on the
Stellar network. A Stellar account is created, it issues an amount of an
asset that is the NFT, it sets data entries on itself describing the digital
or real-world asset tokenized by the asset, and the account is locked
ensuring that the issued NFT has a fixed supply and any data entries created
on the account cannot be changed.

For the most part it appears that the experimental NFTs on Stellar have
converged on similar basic setup. However, there appears to be no common set
of data entries in use.

This fragmentation in the format and definition of data entries describing
NFTs makes it difficult for a developer to display meaningful information
about an NFT within a wallet or block explorer, and for products to
interoperate with NFT assets created by other products.

IPFS documentation recommends a format that this format is based on. Litemint
has been using a subset of this format for sometime, and so there is a growing
number of NFTs on Stellar that are already compatible with this format.

It is worth noting that it is possible that NFTs will appear on Stellar that
do not follow the setup described above and may change substantially such as
by not locking the issuing account, or by other changes. It is not the
motivation of this protocol to limit that possibility, and this protocol does
not define how an NFT is created other than a minimal set of data entries
that describe it.

## Specification

A Stellar account that issues an NFT asset may use the following data entries
to refer to the digital or real-world asset that the NFT tokenizes.

All data entries are optional.

All data entries are within the data entry namespace `nft`. Data entry
namespaces were introduced in [SEP-18].

The presence of any data entry within the `nft` namespace indicates that the
account is an issuer of an NFT asset.

A Stellar account that issues an NFT and uses any of these data entries can
use any additional data entries to describe additional features,
capabilities, or attributes that are unique to the NFT or the product
creating the NFT.

NFTs are referenced and captured in data entries in different formats depending
if the NFT is stored in an IPFS node, a URL, or on-ledger in data entries.

### Format: URL

The following keys are used with the URL encoding type.

The URL format can also be used with IPFS nodes by using the `ipfs://` scheme.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`nft.url[n]` | string | One or more data entries where `n` starts at `0`, where the combined value of all the data entries is a URL to a JSON document containing meta data about the NFT. URLs may be any URL, such as a `https://`, `ipfs://` URL, or `data:image/jpg,base64:...` URL.
`nft.sha256` | string | A SHA-256 hash of the meta data referenced by the `nft.url[n]` data entries.

### Format: IPFS Hash

**This format is deprecated in favor of the URL format and using an `ipfs://`
*scheme, because a URL supports files in directories within an IPFS node.**

When an NFT uses the IPFS hash format it is stored in IPFS and the CID hash of
the meta data JSON document or object is stored as the value.

The following keys are used with the IPFS hash encoding type.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`ipfshash` | string | Present if encoding is `ipfshash`. A single data entry containing an IPFS CID. Equivalent to `nft.url[0]` with a value of `ipfs://<CID>`.
`nft.sha256` | string | A SHA-256 hash of the meta data referenced by the IPFS node referenced by the hash in `ipfshash`.

#### Encoding: `compactv1`

When an asset is compact encoded it's data is encoded into the key and value
fields of data entries inside the Stellar account.

The first 2 bytes of the data encoded into the key are an indexing value from 0
to 999. The last 46 bytes are the first/next chunk of the data. The value is a
slice of 64 bytes of the next chunk of the data buffer. A data entry is added
repeatedly until the data is fully rendered in the keys and values.

#### Examples

##### Example (storing data on IPFS)
Name | Description
-----|------------
`ipfshash` | `QmYyamp4LUZc3vPFN5ohUH2gChQHsbciN89iXbLEeDLQ22`

##### Example (storing data at a URL)

### Meta Format

The meta document referenced by the `nft.url[n]` and `ipfshash` data entries
must be encoded in JSON. The following fields are defined. All fields are
optional.

Any other field may be added to the meta data document to describe additional
features, capabilities, or attributes that are unique to the NFT or the
product creating the NFT.

#### Fields
Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`name` | string | A short name for the NFT.
`description` | string | A long description of the NFT.
`image` | string | A `https://` or `ipfs://` URL to an image.
`image.sha256` | string | A SHA-256 hash of the image data referenced by the `image` URL.

#### Example

```json
{
  "name": "Fall",
  "description": "Photo of leaves üçÅ and sky ‚õÖÔ∏è in San Francisco.",
  "image": "ipfs://Qmeb4iYJGMRSbCSSRgjhmuHyrWFBmhLjGivbiU9SczvX8C",
  "image.sha256": "5a3c6f43d394aa971260d1690b9b200e83c67c5afa8c6c2ae2872e8bcde040af"
}
```

## Design Rationale

This protocol is intentionally lightweight and limited in its specification to
limit the chance that this protocol limits innovation. It describes a minimal
set of data entries ‚Äì one URL and optionally one SHA-256 hash ‚Äì that NFTs can
use to reference the asset being tokenized. These minimal data entries limit the
data required on-network, limiting the cost of issuing NFTs, while providing
enough information for applications to display some meaningful information about
the NFT.

This protocol also defines for field that references data off-network a SHA-256
hash. The hash is of the data file referenced by the URLs and can be used by
applications downloading the data to ensure the data has not changed or been
tampered with. Including hashes of off-chain data is common in NFTs of other
blockchains. The hash can be omitted when the NFT asset is referenced on
networked such as IPFS where the URL is a form of a hash anyway, but is useful
in cases where the asset is a URL to a website.
