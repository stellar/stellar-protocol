## Preamble

```
SEP: 0001
Title: stellar.toml
Author: stellar.org
Status: Approved
Created: 2017-10-30
```

## Simple Summary

The `stellar.toml` file is used to provide a common place where the Internet can find information about your domainâ€™s Stellar integration. Any website can publish Stellar network information. You can announce your validation key, your federation server, peers you are running, your quorum set, if you are a anchor, etc.

## Specification

Given the domain `DOMAIN`, the `stellar.toml` will be searched for at the following location:

```
https://DOMAIN/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

You must enable CORS on the stellar.toml so people can access this file from other sites. The following HTTP header must be set for a HTTP response for `/.well-known/stellar.toml` file request.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

`stellar.toml` is in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file format.

<<List of fields here>>

## Testing

1. Run a curl command in your terminal similar to the following (replace stellar.org with the hosting location of your stellar.toml file):

```sh
curl --head https://stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

2. Verify the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present as shown below.

```sh
curl --head https://stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-length: 482
...
```

3. Also run the command on a page that should not have it and verify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing.
