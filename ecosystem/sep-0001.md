## Preamble

```
SEP: 0001
Title: stellar.toml
Author: stellar.org
Status: Approved
Created: 2017-10-30
```

## Simple Summary

The `stellar.toml` file is used to provide a common place where the Internet can find information about your domain’s Stellar integration. Any website can publish Stellar network information. You can announce your validation key, your federation server, peers you are running, your quorum set, if you are a anchor, etc.

## Specification

Given the domain `DOMAIN`, the `stellar.toml` will be searched for at the following location:

```
https://DOMAIN/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

You must enable CORS on the stellar.toml so people can access this file from other sites. The following HTTP header must be set for a HTTP response for `/.well-known/stellar.toml` file request.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

`stellar.toml` is in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file format.

<<List of fields here>>

## Testing

1. Run a curl command in your terminal similar to the following (replace stellar.org with the hosting location of your stellar.toml file):

```sh
curl --head https://stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

2. Verify the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present as shown below.

```sh
curl --head https://stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-length: 482
...
```

3. Also run the command on a page that should not have it and verify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing.
