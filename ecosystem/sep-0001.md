## Simple Summary

The `stellar.toml` file is used to provide a common place where the Internet can find information about your domain’s Stellar integration. Any website can publish Stellar network information. You can announce your validation key, your federation server, peers you are running, your quorum set, if you are an anchor, etc.

If you are an anchor or issuer, the `stellar.toml` file serves a very important purpose. It allows you to publish information about your organization and token(s) that help to legitimize your offerings. Clients and exchanges can use this information to decide whether a token should be listed. Fully and truthfully disclosing contact and business information is an essential step in responsible token issuance.

## Specification

Given the domain `DOMAIN`, the `stellar.toml` will be searched for at the following location:

```
https://DOMAIN/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

You must enable CORS on the stellar.toml so people can access this file from other sites. The following HTTP header must be set for a HTTP response for `/.well-known/stellar.toml` file request.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

`stellar.toml` is in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file format.

### Global fields

### TOML Table: [PROSPECTUS]

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
ORG_NAME | string | Legal name of your organization
ORG_DBA | string | (may not apply) [DBA](https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/doing-business-as-dba) of your organization

ORG_LOGO | url | Your organization's logo
ORG_DESCRIPTION | string | Short description of your organization
ORG_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS | string | Physical address for your organization
ORG_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_ATTESTATION | `https://` url | URL on the same domain as your `ORG_URL` that contains an image or pdf official document attesting to your physical address.

E.g. a utility bill, mail from a financial institution, or business license.
ORG_PHONE_NUMBER | string | Your organization's phone number
ORG_PHONE_NUMBER_ATTESTATION | `https://` url | URL on the same domain as your `ORG_URL` that contains an image or pdf of a phone bill showing both the phone number and your organization's name.
ORG_KEYBASE | string | A [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) account name for your organization. Should contain proof of ownership of any public online accounts you list here, including your organization's domain.
ORG_TWITTER | string | Your organization's Twitter account
ORG_GITHUB | string | Your organization's Github account
ORG_OFFICIAL_EMAIL | string | An email where clients can contact your organization. Must be hosted at your `ORG_URL` domain.
ORG_LICENSING_AUTHORITY | string | Name of the authority or agency that licensed your organization, if applicable
ORG_LICENSE_TYPE | string | Type of financial or other license your organization holds, if applicable
ORG_LICENSE_NUMBER | string | Official license number of your organization, if applicable

Issuers that list verified information including phone/address attestations and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) verifications will be prioritized by Stellar clients.

### List: [[PRINCIPALS]]

The `[[PRINCIPALS]]` list contains identifying information for principal(s) of the organization.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
name | string | Full legal name
email | string | Business email address for the principal
keybase | string | Personal Keybase account. Should include proof of ownership for other online accounts, as well as the organization's domain.
twitter | string | Personal Twitter account
github | string | Personal Github account
id_photo_hash | string | SHA-512 hash of a photo of the principal's government-issued photo ID
verification_photo_hash | string | SHA-512 hash of a verification photo of principal. Should be well-lit and contain: principal holding ID card and signed, hand-written message stating `I, $NAME, am a principal of $ORG_NAME, a Stellar token issuer.`

The photo hashes allow principals to provide proof of identity to businesses and important clients. The photos can be sent privately, and the recipient can verify that the hashes match. Wallets and Stellar exchanges may request this information from an issuer and add an "ID verified" badge to the issuer's tokens in their interface.

### List: [[CURRENCIES]]

The fields below are for each item in the toml list. Fill in completely, and exclude any fields that do not apply.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
code | string (<= 12 char) | Token code
issuer | `G...` string | Token issuer Stellar public key
display_decimals | int (0 to 7) | Preference for number of decimals to show when a client displays currency balance
name | string (<= 20 char) | A short name for the token
desc | string | Description of token and what it represents
conditions | string | Conditions on token
image | url | URL to image representing token
fixed_number | int | Fixed number of tokens, if the number of tokens issued will never change
max_number | int | Max number of tokens, if there will never be more than `max_number` tokens
is_unlimited | bool | The number of tokens is dilutable at the issuer's discretion
anchor_asset_type | string | Type of asset anchored. Can be `fiat`, `crypto`, `stock`, `bond`, `commodity`, `realestate`, or `other`.
anchor_asset | string | If anchored token, asset that token is anchored to. E.g. USD, BTC, SBUX, Address of real-estate investment property.
redemption_instructions | string | If anchored token, these are instructions to redeem the underlying asset from tokens.
collateral_addresses | list of crypto address strings | If this is an anchored crypto token, list of one or more public addresses that hold the assets for which you are issuing tokens.
collateral_address_signatures | list of signature strings | These prove you control the `collateral_addresses`. For each address you list, sign the message stated below with the address's private key and add the resulting string to this list.

Message to sign for `collateral_address_signatures`:

```
The assets in this account are reserved to back $CODE issued by $ISSUER_ADDRESS on Stellar.
```

Replace `$CODE` with your asset code, and `$ISSUER_ADDRESS` with the issuing Stellar public key. `collateral_addresses` can be used to externally validate that you hold a reserve for the crypto funds you are issing on Stellar. Issuers that hold a provable 100% reserve are prioritized by wallets and clients. Issuers not meeting this standard may not be listed.

Note: `fixed_number`, `max_number`, and `is_unlimited` are mutually exclusive issuance policies. Include exactly one of those fields.

Alternately, `stellar.toml` can link out to a seperate toml for each currency by specifying `toml="https://DOMAIN/.well-known/CURRENCY.toml"` as the currency's only field.

### Table: [QUORUM_SET]

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
VALIDATORS | list of `G...` strings | List of authoritative validators for organization. This can potentially be a quorum set. Names defined in `NODE_NAMES` can be used as well, prefixed with `$`.

## Testing

1. Run a curl command in your terminal similar to the following (replace stellar.org with the hosting location of your stellar.toml file):

```sh
curl --head https://stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

2. Verify the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present as shown below.

```sh
curl --head https://stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-length: 482
...
```

3. Also run the command on a page that should not have it and verify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing.
