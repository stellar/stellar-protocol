## Simple Summary

The `stellar.toml` file is used to provide a common place where the Internet can find information about your domain’s Stellar integration. Any website can publish Stellar network information. You can announce your validation key, your federation server, peers you are running, your quorum set, if you are an anchor, etc.

If you are an anchor or issuer, the `stellar.toml` file serves a very important purpose. It allows you to publish information about your organization and token(s) that help to legitimize your offerings. Clients and exchanges can use this information to decide whether a token should be listed. Fully and truthfully disclosing contact and business information is an essential step in responsible token issuance.

## Specification

Given the domain `DOMAIN`, the `stellar.toml` will be searched for at the following location:

```
https://DOMAIN/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

You must enable CORS on the `stellar.toml` so people can access this file from other sites. The following HTTP header must be set for a HTTP response for `/.well-known/stellar.toml` file request.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

`stellar.toml` is in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file format. The `stellar.toml` fields and sections are described below. You should complete as much of this as you can. Many Stellar apps, including important wallets and exchanges, make decisions on which tokens to support based on the completeness of their Account Information and Documentation sections.

### Account Information

These are global fields in the `stellar.toml` file.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
FEDERATION_SERVER | uses `https://` | The endpoint for clients to resolve stellar addresses for users on your domain via [SEP-2](sep-0002.md) federation protocol
AUTH_SERVER | uses `https://` | The endpoint used for [SEP-3](sep-0003.md) compliance protocol
TRANSFER_SERVER | uses `https://` | The endpoint used for [SEP-6](sep-0006.md) Anchor/Client interoperability
SIGNING_KEY | Stellar public key | The signing key is used for the compliance protocol
NODE_NAMES | list of `"G... name"` strings | convenience mapping of common names to node IDs. You can use these common names in sections below instead of the less friendly nodeID. This is provided mainly to be compatible with the stellar-core.cfg
ACCOUNTS | list of `G...` strings | A list of Stellar accounts that are controlled by this domain. Names defined in `NODE_NAMES` can be used as well, prefixed with `$`.
OUR_VALIDATORS | list of `G...` strings | A list of validator public keys that are declared to be used by this domain for validating ledgers. They are authorized signers for the domain. Names defined in `NODE_NAMES` can be used as well, prefixed with `$`.
ASSET_VALIDATOR | `G...` string | The validator through which the issuer pledges to honor redemption transactions, and which therefore maintains the authoritative ownership records for assets issued by this organization.  Specified as a public key `G...` or `NODE_NAME` prefixed with `$`. This field may also contain a list of validators.  In this case, transactions must be processed by _all_ listed validators.  In the event that this field specifies multiple validators and they do not all agree, then the authoritative ownership records will be the last ledger number on which all validators agree.
DESIRED_BASE_FEE | int | Your preference for the Stellar network base fee, expressed in stroops
DESIRED_MAX_TX_PER_LEDGER | int | Your preference for max number of transactions per ledger close
KNOWN_PEERS | list of strings | List of known Stellar core servers, listed from most to least trusted if known. Can be `IP:port`, `IPv6:port`, or `domain:port` with the `:port` optional.
HISTORY | list of URL strings | List of history archives maintained by this domain

### Issuer Documentation

These fields go in the `stellar.toml` `[DOCUMENTATION]` table.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
ORG_NAME | string | Legal name of your organization
ORG_DBA | string | (may not apply) [DBA](https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/doing-business-as-dba) of your organization
ORG_URL | uses `https://` | Your organization's official URL. Your `stellar.toml` must be hosted on the same domain.
ORG_LOGO | url | Your organization's logo
ORG_DESCRIPTION | string | Short description of your organization
ORG_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS | string | Physical address for your organization
ORG_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_ATTESTATION | `https://` url | URL on the same domain as your `ORG_URL` that contains an image or pdf official document attesting to your physical address. It must list your `ORG_NAME` or `ORG_DBA` as the party at the address. Only documents from an official third party are acceptable. E.g. a utility bill, mail from a financial institution, or business license.
ORG_PHONE_NUMBER | string | Your organization's phone number
ORG_PHONE_NUMBER_ATTESTATION | `https://` url | URL on the same domain as your `ORG_URL` that contains an image or pdf of a phone bill showing both the phone number and your organization's name.
ORG_KEYBASE | string | A [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) account name for your organization. Should contain proof of ownership of any public online accounts you list here, including your organization's domain.
ORG_TWITTER | string | Your organization's Twitter account
ORG_GITHUB | string | Your organization's Github account
ORG_OFFICIAL_EMAIL | string | An email where clients can contact your organization. Must be hosted at your `ORG_URL` domain.
ORG_LICENSING_AUTHORITY | string | Name of the authority or agency that licensed your organization, if applicable
ORG_LICENSE_TYPE | string | Type of financial or other license your organization holds, if applicable
ORG_LICENSE_NUMBER | string | Official license number of your organization, if applicable

Issuers that list verified information including phone/address attestations and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) verifications will be prioritized by Stellar clients.

### Point of Contact Documentation

These fields go in the `stellar.toml` `[[PRINCIPALS]]` list. It contains identifying information for the primary point of contact or principal(s) of the organization.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
name | string | Full legal name
email | string | Business email address for the principal
keybase | string | Personal Keybase account. Should include proof of ownership for other online accounts, as well as the organization's domain.
telegram | string | Personal Telegram account
twitter | string | Personal Twitter account
github | string | Personal Github account
id_photo_hash | string | SHA-256 hash of a photo of the principal's government-issued photo ID
verification_photo_hash | string | SHA-256 hash of a verification photo of principal. Should be well-lit and contain: principal holding ID card and signed, dated, hand-written message stating `I, $NAME, am a principal of $ORG_NAME, a Stellar token issuer with address $ISSUER_ADDRESS.`

`$NAME` is the principal's full legal name, `$ORG_NAME` is the name of the organization and must match the value in the `stellar.toml` file, and `$ISSUER_ADDRESS` is the Stellar address of the organization/issuer.

The photo hashes allow principals to provide proof of identity to businesses and important clients. The photos can be sent privately, and the recipient can verify that the hashes match. Wallets and Stellar exchanges may request this information from an issuer and add an "ID verified" badge to the issuer's tokens in their interface.

The public key in the verification photo should be the issuing public key for the issuer's assets. If there are multiple, please include the multiple keys in the statement.

### Currency Documentation

These fields go in the `stellar.toml` `[[CURRENCIES]]` list, one set of fields for each currency issued. Complete all applicable fields, and exclude any that don't apply.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
code | string (<= 12 char) | Token code
code_template | string (<= 12 char) | A pattern with `?` as a single character wildcard. Allows a `[[CURRENCIES]]` entry to apply to multiple assets that share the same info. An example is futures, where the only difference between issues is the date of the contract. E.g. `CORN????????` to match codes such as `CORN20180604`.
issuer | `G...` string | Token issuer Stellar public key
status | string | Status of token. One of `live`, `dead`, `test`. Allows issuer to mark whether token is dead/for testing or is live and should be listed in live exchanges.
display_decimals | int (0 to 7) | Preference for number of decimals to show when a client displays currency balance
name | string (<= 20 char) | A short name for the token
desc | string | Description of token and what it represents
conditions | string | Conditions on token
image | url | URL to image representing token
fixed_number | int | Fixed number of tokens, if the number of tokens issued will never change
max_number | int | Max number of tokens, if there will never be more than `max_number` tokens
is_unlimited | bool | The number of tokens is dilutable at the issuer's discretion
anchor_asset_type | string | Type of asset anchored. Can be `fiat`, `crypto`, `stock`, `bond`, `commodity`, `realestate`, or `other`.
anchor_asset | string | If anchored token, asset that token is anchored to. E.g. USD, BTC, SBUX, Address of real-estate investment property.
redemption_instructions | string | If anchored token, these are instructions to redeem the underlying asset from tokens.
collateral_addresses | list of crypto address strings | If this is an anchored crypto token, list of one or more public addresses that hold the assets for which you are issuing tokens.
collateral_address_signatures | list of signature strings | These prove you control the `collateral_addresses`. For each address you list, sign the message stated below with the address's private key and add the resulting string to this list.

Message to sign for `collateral_address_signatures`:

```
The assets in the account $PUBLIC_KEY are reserved to back $CODE issued by $ISSUER_ADDRESS on Stellar. Valid from $START to $END.
```

Replace `$PUBLIC_KEY` with the account's public key, `$CODE` with your asset code, `$ISSUER_ADDRESS` with the issuing Stellar address and `$START`, `$END` with the date range in ISO 8601 for which the reserve is valid. `$END` cannot be more than a year in the future to ensure yearly renewals of the commitment. `collateral_addresses` can be used to externally validate that you hold a reserve for the crypto funds you are issuing on Stellar. Issuers that hold a provable 100% reserve are prioritized by wallets and clients. Issuers not meeting this standard may not be listed.

Note: `fixed_number`, `max_number`, and `is_unlimited` are mutually exclusive issuance policies. Include exactly one of those fields.

Alternately, `stellar.toml` can link out to a separate TOML file for each currency by specifying `toml="https://DOMAIN/.well-known/CURRENCY.toml"` as the currency's only field.

### Validator Information

These fields go in the `stellar.toml` `[QUORUM_SET]` table.

Field | Requirements | Description
------|--------------|------------
VALIDATORS | list of `G...` strings | List of authoritative validators for organization. This can potentially be a quorum set. Names defined in `NODE_NAMES` can be used as well, prefixed with `$`.

## Testing

1. Run a curl command in your terminal similar to the following (replace stellar.org with the hosting location of your `stellar.toml` file):

```sh
curl --head https://stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

2. Verify the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is present as shown below.

```sh
curl --head https://stellar.org/.well-known/stellar.toml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-length: 482
...
```

3. Also run the command on a page that should not have it and verify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing.
