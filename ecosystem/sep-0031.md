## Simple Summary

This SEP defines a protocol for enabling payments between two financial accounts that exist outside the Stellar network.

## Abstract

The entities involved in a transaction are:

- A **Sending Client**: The owner of the origin financial account.
- A **Sending Anchor**: The business receiving funds from the Sending Client and delivering them to the Receiving Anchor for the Receiving Client. Must have a business relationship with the Receiving Anchor.
- A **Receiving Anchor**: The business receiving funds from the Sending Anchor and delivering them to the Receiving Client.
- A **Receiving Client**: The owner of the destination financial account.

At a high level, the following steps are performed to complete a transaction:

1. The Sending Client sends funds from their financial account to the Sending Anchor's financial account (off/on-Stellar)
2. The Sending Anchor sends the funds to the Receiving Anchor's Stellar account (on-Stellar)
3. The Receiving Anchor sends funds to the Receiving Client's financial account (off-Stellar)

Typically, the Sending and Receiving Clients reside in different regulatory jurisdictions and therefore a payment between their financial accounts must be facilitated by two business entities, the Sending and Receiving Anchors, who have the necessary licenses in their respective jurisdictions.

## Example

Alice in Nigeria wants to send money to Bob in Europe. Alice signs up with NigeriaPay to make this payment to send money directly into Bob’s bank account. Bob doesn’t need to do anything, or know anything about this payment, besides letting Alice know what his bank account information is. Alice only needs to deal with her anchor (NigeriaPay). Alice passes this information and her money to NigeriaPay, and NigeriaPay sends those funds to the EuroPay Anchor service, and Europay deposits those funds into Bob’s bank account.

## Prerequisites

* The Receiving Anchor must define `DIRECT_PAYMENT_SERVER` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md).
* The Sending and Receiving Anchors must create bi-lateral agreements to interoperate with each other.
* If the Receiving Anchor requires KYC information for the Sending or Receiving Clients, the Receiving Anchor must implement [SEP-12](sep-0012.md) and define a `KYC_SERVER` in their [stellar.toml](sep-0001.md).

## Authentication

Sending Anchors must authenticate with Receiving Anchors via [SEP-10 Web Authentication](sep-0010.md). Sending Anchors must provide the Stellar account they will authenticate with to their Receiving Anchors, and Receiving Anchors must ensure that the authenticated Stellar account belongs to a Sending Anchor for which a bi-lateral agreement has been made.

The SEP-10 JWT be included as a header in requests to all endpoints:

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

Any API request that fails to meet proper authentication should return a 403 Forbidden response.

## HTTPS Only

This protocol involves the transfer of value, and so HTTPS is required for all endpoints for security.  Anchors should refuse to interact with any insecure HTTP endpoints.

## Content Type

All endpoints accept in requests the following `Content-Type`s:

- `application/json`

All endpoints respond with content type:

- `application/json`

## API Endpoints

* [`GET /info`](#get-info)
* [`POST /transactions`](#post-transactions)
* [`GET /transactions/:id`](#get-transaction)
* [`PATCH /transactions/:id`](#patch-transaction)

### Detailed Sending Anchor Flow

1. The Sending Client iniates a payment to the Receiving Client.
1. The Sending Anchor identifies the Receiving Anchor it will use for the payment based on the receipient's location.
1. The Sending Anchor makes a request to the Receiving Anchor's `GET /info` endpoint to collect asset information and the `transaction.fields` describing the transaction-related information required by the Receiving Anchor.
1. The Sending Anchor fetches the relevant KYC `type` values from the `sep12` object for the Sending and Receiving Client. If no `type` values are defined for either client, KYC information is not required for that client.
1. The Sending Anchor makes [SEP-12 GET /customer?type=](sep-0012.md#customer-get) requests for the Sending and Receiving Clients. The response includes the [SEP-9](sep-0009.md) KYC attributes required for registering a client of the associated `type`.
1. The Sending Anchor collects all required information from the Sending Client. This includes the custom fields listed in the Receiving Anchor's `GET /info` response as well as the KYC fields described in the `GET /customer` responses for both the Sending and Recieving Clients. How the Sending Anchor collects this information from the Sending Client is out of the scope of this document, but the Receving Client should not be required to take any action in order for the Sending Client to make the payment to the Receiving Anchor.
1. The Sending Anchor makes [SEP-12 PUT /customer](sep-0012.md#customer-put) requests containing the collected information for each client.
1. On successful registration (`202` HTTP status), the Sending Anchor makes a `POST /transactions` request to create a transaction record with the Receiving Anchor. This request contains the `id`s returned by the `PUT /customer` requests, the `transaction.fields` values collected from the Sending Client, as well as the transaction amount and asset information. The response will include a `id` that will be used to check the status of the transaction.
1. The Sending Anchor makes `GET /transactions/:id` requests until the transaction's `status` is `pending_sender`. 
1. The Sending Anchor submits the payment transaction to Stellar using the information provided in the `POST /transactions` response.
1. The Sending Anchor makes `GET /transactions/:id` requests until the transaction's `status` is `completed`, `error`, `pending_customer_info_update`, or `pending_transaction_info_update`.
1. If `completed`, the Sending Anchor should notify the Sending Client that funds have been delivered to the Receiving Client.
1. If `error`, the Receiving Anchor should be contacted to resolve the situation.
1. If `pending_transaction_info_update`, the `transaction.fields` values collected from the Sending Client were invalid and must be corrected by the Sending Client. See the [Pending Transaction Info Update](#pending-transaction-info-update) section for more information.
1. If `pending_customer_info_update`, the SEP-9 KYC values collected were invalid and must be corrected by the Sending Client. See the [Pending Customer Info Update](#pending-customer-info-update) section for more information.
1. After providing the Receiving Anchor with updated values, the status should ultimately change to `completed`.

### Detailed Receiving Anchor Flow

1. The Sending Anchor makes a request to the Receiving Anchor's `GET /info` endpoint.
1. The Sending Anchor makes a `SEP-12 GET /customer` request for the Sending and Receiving Clients if required.
1. The Sending Anchor makes a `SEP-12 PUT /customer` request for the Sending and Receiving Clients if required.
  1. The Receiving Anchor must validate the KYC data provided and reject the request with useful error messages if invalid.
1. The Sending Anchor makes a `POST /transactions` request.
  1. The Receiving Anchor must ensure the asset, amount, transaction fields, and customers IDs are valid.
  1. The Recieving Anchor must create a transaction record in their database and expose it via `GET /transactions/:id`.
  1. Transactions should initially be `pending_sender`. If any preprocessing is required before receiving a payment, mark the transaction as `pending_receiver` until ready to receive funds.
1. The Receiving Anchor then waits to receive the payment identified by the `stellar_memo` returned in the `POST /transactions` response.
1. Once the Stellar payment has been received and matched with the internal transaction record, the Receiving Anchor must attempt to transfer an equivalent amount of the asset (minus fees) off-chain to the Receiving Client using the KYC and rails data collected by the Sending Anchor.
1. If the off-chain payment succeeds, the transaction's status should be updated to `completed`.
1. If the off-chain payment cannot be received by the Recieving Client almost immediately, the transaction's status should be updated to `pending_external` until received.
1. If the off-chain payment fails, the Recieving Anchor must determine why, which is outside the scope of this document. Once determined, the Receiving Anchor must either correct it themselves (internal error) or receive updated values from the Sending Anchor for the fields that were discovered to be invalid.
  1. If the invalid values were described in `GET /info`'s `transaction.fields` object, the transaction's status should be updated to `pending_transaction_info_update` and `required_info_updates` should contain an object describing the errors.
  1. If the invalid values were described in `SEP-12 GET /customer` responses, the transaction's status should be updated to `pending_customer_info_update` and the invalid field names should be returned in the next `GET /customer?id=` request for each Client.
  1. The Sending Anchor will detect the transaction's status and invalid fields, collect the info from the Sending Client, and make requests to the Receiving Anchor containing the updated information.
  1. Once the provided information is validated, the Receiving Anchor should update the transaction's status to `pending_receiver` and retry the off-chain transfer. This loop of attempting the transfer and waiting for updated information should continue until the transfer is successful.

`required_info_message` | string | (optional) A human-readable message indicating any errors that require updated information from the sender.
`required_info_updates` | object | (optional) A set of fields that require update values from the Sending Anchor, in the same format as described in [GET /info](#get-info).  This field is only relevant when `status` is `pending_transaction_info_update`.

`status` should be one of:

* `pending_sender` -- awaiting payment to be sent by Sending Anchor.
* `pending_stellar` -- transaction has been submitted to Stellar network, but is not yet confirmed.
* `pending_customer_info_update` -- certain pieces of information need to be updated by the Sending Anchor. See the [Pending Customer Info Update](#pending-customer-info-update) section for more information.
* `pending_transaction_info_update` -- certain pieces of information need to be updated by the Sending Anchor. See the [Pending Transaction Info Update](#pending-transaction-info-update) section for more information.
* `pending_receiver` -- payment is being processed by the Receiving Anchor.
* `pending_external` -- payment has been submitted to external network, but is not yet confirmed.
* `completed` -- funds have been delivered to the Receiving Client.
* `error` -- catch-all for any error not enumerated above.

Example response:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
      "id": "82fhs729f63dh0v4",
      "status": "pending_external",
      "status_eta": 3600,
      "external_transaction_id": "ABCDEFG1234567890",
      "amount_in": "18.34",
      "amount_out": "18.24",
      "amount_fee": "0.1",
      "started_at": "2017-03-20T17:05:32Z"
    }
}
```


```json
{
  "transaction": {
      "id": "82fhs729f63dh0v4",
      "status": "pending_transaction_info_update",
      "status_eta": 3600,
      "external_transaction_id": "ABCDEFG1234567890",
      "amount_in": "18.34",
      "amount_out": "18.24",
      "amount_fee": "0.1",
      "started_at": "2017-03-20T17:05:32Z",
      "required_info_message": "The bank reported an incorrect account number for the receiver, please ensure the account matches legal documents",
      "required_info_updates": {
         "transaction": {
            "receiver_account_number": {
               "description": "The receiver's bank account number"
            }
         }
      }
    }
}
```

If the transaction cannot be found, the endpoint should return a `404 NOT FOUND` result.

#### Pending Customer Info Update

In certain cases the Receiving Anchor might need to request updated information from the Sending Anchor.  For example, if the bank tells the Receiving Anchor that the provided Receiving Client's name is incorrect or missing a middle initial. Since this information was sent via SEP-12, the transaction should go into the `pending_customer_info_update` state until the Sending Anchor makes another `SEP-12 PUT /customer` request to update. The Sending Anchor can check which fields need to be updated by making a `SEP-12 GET /customer` request including the `id` or `account` & `memo` parameters. The Receiving Anchor should respond with a `NEEDS_INFO` status and `last_name` included in the fields described.

#### Pending Transaction Info Update

Another possibility is that the per-transaction information provided in the `POST /transactions` `fields` object was later discovered to be invalid. In this case, the transaction should go into the `pending_transaction_info_update` state until the Sending Anchor makes a request to the endpoint outlined below. 

### PATCH Transaction

This endpoint should only be used when the Receiver Anchor requests more info via the `pending_transaction_info_update` status.  The `required_info_updates` transaction field should contain the fields required for the update. If the Sending Anchor tries to update at a time when no info is requested, the Receiver Anchor should fail with an error response.

```
PATCH DIRECT_PAYMENT_SERVER/transactions/:id
```

Request parameters:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | The id of the transaction.
`fields` | object | A key-pair object containing the values requested to be updated by the receiving anchor in the same format as `fields` in the [`POST /transactions`](#post-transactions) request.

#### Example

```
PATCH DIRECT_PAYMENT_SERVER/transactions/82fhs729f63dh0v4

{
   "fields": {
      "transaction": {
         "receiver_bank_account": "12345678901234",
         "receiver_routing_number": "021000021"
      }
   }
}
```

#### Success 200 OK

If the information was successfully updated, respond with a 200 status code, and return a response body matching `GET /transactions/:id`. The transaction should return to `pending_receiver`, though it is possible that the information could still need to be updated again.

#### Not Found 404

If the transaction specified by `"id"` does not exist, return a 404 response.

#### Error 400

If the information was malformed, or if the sender tried to update data that isn't updatable, return a 400 with an object containing an error message.

```
{
   "error": "Supplied fields do not allow updates, please only try to updates the fields requested"
}
