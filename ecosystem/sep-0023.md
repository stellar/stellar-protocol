## Simple Summary

Strkey is an ASCII format for representing Stellar account IDs and
addresses.  This document introduces augmented strkey to represent
account IDs for multiplexed addresses introduced by CAP-0027.

## Motivation

A common pattern in the Stellar ecosystem is for services to share a
single Stellar account ID across many users or independent
transactions, relying on the memo ID to disambiguate incoming
payments.  CAP-0027 introduced the `MuxedAccount` type, which allows
an address to be paired with a 64-bit ID.  This document extends the
Strkey format to allow the specification of an arbitrary
`MuxedAccount` as a string.  If widely adopted by the ecosystem, users
will be able to use custodial services and exchanges in much the same
way as wallets, by specifying a `MuxedAccount` instead of a separate
`AccountID` and `Memo`.

## Abstract

A new strkey format is introduced to represent both the public key and
64-bit ID of a `MuxedAccount`, as specified in CAP-0027.

## Specification

Strkey, the ASCII encoding for accounts, keys, and signers, currently
covers covered ED25519 public keys, ED25519 private keys (also known
as seeds), pre-authorized transaction hashes, and hash-x signers
(which provide signing authority upon revelation of a SHA-256
preimage). We make two changes:  First, we add a new type of strkey
for multiplexed account IDs, represented by a new value in the top 5
bits of the version byte, which is the 8 bits of the key.  The
possible "base" values (top 5 bits) of the version byte, which
determine the first character of the base-32 encoding of the key, are
listed here:

| Key type                | Base value   | First char | Muxed | Alg  |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- | ---- |
| STRKEY\_PUBKEY          | 6 << 3       | G          | no    | PK   |
| STRKEY\_MUXED           | 12 << 3      | M          | yes   | PK   |
| STRKEY\_PRIVKEY         | 18 << 3      | S          | no    | PK   |
| STRKEY\_PRE\_AUTH\_TX   | 19 << 3      | T          | no    | Hash |
| STRKEY\_HASH\_X         | 23 << 3      | X          | no    | Hash |

Second, instead of requiring the low 3 bits of the version byte to be
zero, we now use them as an algorithm specifier.  Thus, a version byte
becomes the bitwise OR of a base value above and one of the algorithm
specifiers from the two tables below.  (These tables will be extended
when Stellar adds additional crypto algorithms.)

| PK Algorithm                | Value |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| STRKEY\_ALG\_ED25519        | 0     |


| Hash Algorithm              | Value |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| STRKEY\_ALG\_SHA256         | 0     |

The following steps transform a binary key into a strkey:

1.  Start with the appropriate version byte computed by the OR of a
    key type base value and algorithm selector from the tables above.

2.  If we are encoding a multiplexed address, append an 8-byte memo ID
    in network byte order (most significant byte first).

3.  Append the binary bytes of the key (e.g., 32-bytes for ED25519).

4.  Compute a 16-bit CRC16 checksum of the combined version byte,
    optional memo ID, and binary key (using polynomial
    x<sup>16</sup> + x<sup>12</sup> + x<sup>5</sup> + 1). Append the
    two-byte checksum to the result of the previous step (e.g.,
    producing a 35-byte quantity for a non-multiplexed ED25519 public
    key, or 43 byte quantity for a multiplexed one).

3.  Encode the result of the previous step using [RFC4648 base-32
    encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-6) without
    padding.  For example, a multiplexed address yields a 43-byte
    quantity whose base-32 encoding is 69 bytes with no trailing `=`
    signs because no padding is allowed.

To transform a strkey into a binary key, the process is simply
reversed.  However, a strkey is only valid if re-encoding the binary
key yields the exact same strkey.  Note, in particular, that a
strkey's length **must not** be congruent to 1, 3, or 6 mod 8, and
unused bits of the last symbol must be zero.  Some non-padding base32
libraries, such as the one in the standard go
library&mdash;`base32.StdEncoding.WithPadding(base32.NoPadding)`&mdash;do
not enforce these requirements.  Therefore, implementations of strkey
decoding **must** check and reject such invalid inputs, or perform a
round-trip and reject strkey inputs that do not re-encode to the exact
same string.

### Horizon API changes

The following proposed Horizon API changes would expose multiplexed
accounts in a backwards-compatible way:

* Anyplace a MuxedAccount appears, if the account is of a multiplexed
  type (currently just `KEY_TYPE_MUXED_ED2551`), two new fields are
  added to the JSON.

    - Base field name + `_muxed` is the strkey of the multiplexed
      account.  (For non-multiplexed accounts, this will be the same
      as `account_id`.)

    - Base field name + `_id` is the integer.

  For example, given the MuxedAccount
  `MAAAAAAAAAAAJURAAB2X52XFQP6FBXLGT6LWOOWMEXWHEWBDVRZ7V5WH34Y22MPFBHUHY`,
  you might get the following fields:

~~~
    account_id: GAQAA5L65LSYH7CQ3VTJ7F3HHLGCL3DSLAR2Y47263D56MNNGHSQSTVY
    account_id_id: 1234
    account_id_muxed: MAAAAAAAAAAAJURAAB2X52XFQP6FBXLGT6LWOOWMEXWHEWBDVRZ7V5WH34Y22MPFBHUHY
~~~~

* Queries for a multiplexed MuxedAccount (starting M...) return only
  operations that touch that particular multiplexed account ID.

* Queries for non-multiplexed accounts (starting G...) return all
  transactions affecting the account, including multiplexed
  subaccounts.  As an exception, a new optional query parameter
  `nomux=1` returns only transaction operations that are to the
  non-multiplexed representation of the target account (e.g.,
  `KEY_TYPE_ED25519` not `KEY_TYPE_MUXED_ED2551`).

## Implementation

## Tests

Implementations of strkey must accept the following valid test cases
and reject the invalid test cases.  Common bugs such as forgetting to
reject strkeys with length congruent to 1, 3, or 6 mod 8 before
invoking base-32 decoding will cause software to accept the invalid
test cases, which could in turn cause security problems.

## Design Rationale

If widely adopted by the ecosystem, naming a multiplexed account with
a single string will allow multiplexed accounts to be used as end-user
addresses.

## Security Concerns

Augmented strkey could potentially make it harder to see where
payments are going, as different multiplexed accounts will reference
the same underlying account.
