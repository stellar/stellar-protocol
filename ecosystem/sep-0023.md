## Simple Summary

Strkey is an ASCII format for representing Stellar account IDs and
addresses.  This document introduces augmented strkey to represent
account IDs that are multiplexed across users or separate transactions
and hence must be used in conjunction with a particular memo ID.

## Motivation

A common pattern in the Stellar ecosystem is for services to share a
single Stellar account ID across many users or independent
transactions, relying on the memo ID to disambiguate incoming
payments.  Unfortunately, experience shows that people frequently
forget to include the memo ID, resulting in either lost funds or
onerous support calls.  Hence, we need a way to specify an address and
memo together in a way that is difficult for end-users to misuse.

## Abstract

A new strkey format is introduced for _multiplexed_ addresses that can
only be used as a destination address and only in conjunction with a
particular memo ID.

## Specification

To multiplex a Stellar account over multiple users, the account must
be used in conjunction with a particular memo ID.  Because the memo
field is per-transaction rather than per-operation, this places
restrictions on the use of such multiplexing.  In particular:

* A multiplexed address can occur only as the `destination` field of a
  `PAYMENT`, `PATH_PAYMENT`, or `ACCOUNT_MERGE` operation.

* At most one multiplexed address can appear in a given transaction.

### Native representation

Because multiplexed addresses cannot be used everyplace a normal
account can be, implementations must represent them using a distinct
type.  Since this representation depends on the language, we give a
suggested implementation in XDR:

~~~ {.c}
struct MultiplexedAccountID {
  uint64 *memoID;
  AccountID accountID;
};
~~~

If `memoID` is `NULL`, the structure should be considered equivalent
to a simple `AccountID`.  Otherwise, it is a multiplexed `AccountID`
subject to the restrictions above, and must have a `MEMO_ID`.

### Encoding

Strkey provides a compact ASCII format for ED25519 public keys,
ED25519 private keys (also known as seeds), pre-authorized transaction
hashes, and hash-x signers (which provide signing authority upon
revelation of a SHA-256 preimage). We add a fifth type representing
multiplexed account IDs named by ED25519 keys.  Each of these types
has a corresponding version byte, which determines the first character
of the strkey encoding:

| Key type                | Version byte | First char | Muxed |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| STRKEY\_PUBKEY\_ED25519 | 6 << 3       | G          | no    |
| STRKEY\_PUBKEY\_ED25519 | 12 << 3      | M          | yes   |
| STRKEY\_SEED\_ED25519   | 18 << 3      | S          | no    |
| STRKEY\_PRE\_AUTH\_TX   | 19 << 3      | T          | no    |
| STRKEY\_HASH\_X         | 23 << 3      | X          | no    |


The following steps transform a binary key into a strkey:

1.  Start with the appropriate version byte from the above table.

2.  If it is a multiplexed address, append an 8-byte memo ID in
    network byte order (most significant byte first).

3.  Append the binary bytes of the key (e.g., 32-bytes for ED25519).

4.  Compute a 16-bit CRC16 checksum of the combined version byte,
    optional memo ID, and binary key (using polynomial
    x<sup>16</sup> + x<sup>12</sup> + x<sup>5</sup> + 1). Append the
    two-byte checksum to the result of the previous step (e.g.,
    producing a 35-byte quantity for a non-multiplexed ED25519 public
    key, or 43 byte quantity for a multiplexed one).

3.  Encode the result of the previous step using [RFC4648 base-32
    encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-6).

Note that the version bytes all consist of values shifted left by three because the first character of base-32-encoded output is determined by the most significant 5 bits of the first byte.

## Implementations

The strkey format is already widely used for Stellar. Example imlementations include these in [go](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/master/strkey/main.go), [C++](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/dd7f38dba232e20ae75a95641857c0b7ed0252e1/src/crypto/StrKey.cpp), and [JavaScript](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/blob/master/src/strkey.js).

Augmented strkey will be implemented soon...

## Tests

Coming soon...

## Design Rationale

Cleaner solutions all seem to require changes to stellar-core, e.g.:

* Allow a new `AccountID` type that includes a memo.

* Create a `CREATE_OR_PAY` operation to make it easier to send to
  destination addresses that do not already exist.  This would
  alleviate the main issue behind the need for memos, namely that
  recipients don't want to pre-create accounts and incur the reserve
  requirement.

Because multiplexed addresses cannot be used in the same places as
regular addresses, it seemed useful to pick a new prefix letter for
them.  If Stellar introduces a new type of public key, this could
require a new letter besides 'M' to multiplex those addresses.  On the
other hand, since there are three unused low bits that don't affect
the letter, we might continue to use 'G' and 'M' and use, e.g., 6<<3|1
and 12<<3|1 for the non-muxed and muxed next public key type, and
similarly 18<<3|1 for the corresponding private key.

## Security Concerns

Augmented strkey could potentially make it harder to see where
payments are going.
