## Summary

This proposal defines a standard contract interface for non-fungible tokens. The interface is a similar to ERC721, but factors in the differences between Ethereum and Stellar.

## Motivation

A non-fungible asset (NFT) is a fundamental concept on blockchains, representing unique and indivisible digital assets. While most blockchain ecosystems have established standards for NFTs, such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155 in Ethereum, the Stellar ecosystem lacks a standardized interface for NFTs. This absence may lead to fragmentation, making it difficult to ensure interoperability between different NFT contracts and applications.

Currently, while it is **technically possible** to create NFTs on Stellar by issuing non-divisible assets with unique metadata as outlined in **SEP-39** -and one can deploy the SAC for it afterwards-, this approach is unintuitive for developers, due to SAC is mainly designed for Fungible tokens, and comes with the following limitations:

- **Metadata handling** – SAC NFTs store metadata off-chain, whereas if wanted, smart contract NFTs can store more on-chain metadata with further customizations.
- **Permission controls** – SACs follow the standard asset authorization model, while smart contract NFTs enable fine-grained access controls and custom rules.
- **Transfers & ownership** – SAC NFTs rely on trust-lines and asset balances, whereas smart contract NFTs can implement more explicit and flexible ownership structures.
- **Customizability** – SACs are limited to predefined asset behaviors, whereas smart contract NFTs allow advanced logic like royalties, leasing, or dynamic attributes.

By defining NFTs as smart contracts, developers gain more intuitive and straight-forward way to issue NFTs, along with greater **flexibility, programmability, and interoperability**, enabling use cases beyond simple asset issuance.

This proposal defines a non-fungible token interface that provides core NFT functionality, including ownership management, transfers, and approvals, without enforcing opinionated behaviors beyond the standard expectations for NFTs. By establishing this interface, NFT contracts can interact seamlessly with other contracts and applications that support the standard, ensuring broader usability and compatibility within the Stellar network.

## Events

### Transfer Event

The transfer event is emitted when an NFT is transferred from one address to another.

**Topics:**

- `Symbol` with value `"transfer"`
- Address: the address holding the token that was transferred.
- Address: the address that received the token.

**Data:**

- `u32`: the identifier of the transferred token.

### Approval Event

The approval event is emitted when an owner grants another address permission to manage a specific token.

**Topics:**

- `Symbol` with value `"approval"`
- `Address`: the owner of the token.
- `u32`: the identifier of the token.

**Data:**

- `Address`: the approved address.
- `u32`: the expiration ledger.

### Approval for All Event

The approval for all event is emitted when an owner grants or revokes permission for an operator to manage all of their NFTs.

**Topics:**

- `Symbol` with value `"approval_for_all"`
- `Address`: the owner of the tokens.

**Data:**

- `Address`: the operator receiving or losing permission.
- `u32`: the expiration ledger. If `0`, the approval is revoked.

### Mint Event

The `mint` event is emitted when a token is minted.

The event has topics:

- `Symbol` with value `"mint"`
- `Address`: the address to hold the newly minted token.

The event has data:

- `u32` the identifier of the minted token.

## Notes on `mint()`:

- Minting functionality is typically implemented as an internal function (see [[OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)) to emphasize that the standard does not impose any specific minting logic. This allows developers to adopt an approach that best suits their contract’s requirements. In this SEP, we do not specify any standards for `minting` tokens.

## Notes on `safeTransferFrom`:

- In ERC-721, `safeTransferFrom` and `onERC721Received` exist to prevent the loss of NFTs when transferring them to a smart contract that does not support NFT-related operations.
- However, this approach comes with significant overhead:
    - An additional on-chain transaction is required for verification.
    - The receiving contract must implement `onERC721Received`.
- A more efficient alternative is the [`[permit](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) mechanism (EIP-2612), which leverages off-chain signatures to authorize the recipient to claim the tokens, reducing on-chain transactions from two to one.

## Notes on `permit`:

`safeTransfer` and `onReceive` ensure the recipient can handle NFTs, preventing accidental burns. Unlike fungible tokens, NFTs can’t be broken into tiny fractions, and test-transferred in small amounts.

Stellar’s trust lines offer similar safety but apply to specific assets, whereas safe transfer secures entire asset classes. Soroban removed trust line requirements for contract transfers.

`safeTransferFrom` is relevant for NFT transfers to smart contracts, while `permit` also works for EOAs, addressing the indivisibility issue. Stellar’s built-in signatures provide `permit`-like functionality at the protocol level. For added safety, developers can implement safe variants or leverage existing solutions.

## Notes on `transfer()`:

- The `transfer()` function exists in ERC20 but is absent in ERC721, primarily for historical reasons. In both ERC20 and ERC721, `transferFrom()` can be used instead of `transfer()`, with the the only difference being an additional on-chain check. To avoid redundancy, `transfer()` was omitted from the ERC721 standard.
- Despite this, `transfer()` retains a key advantage over `transferFrom()`: when the token owner initiates the transfer, `transfer()` is more efficient and cost-effective, as it eliminates the need for an extra on-chain verification.
- While we aim for compatibility with other ecosystems, maintaining internal consistency within our own ecosystem takes precedence. The behavior and the use cases of `transfer()` remains the same for both fungible and non-fungible tokens, so we decided to include it for NFTs as well in this SEP.

## Notes on `name()`, `symbol()` and `token_uri()`

- Those methods are not part of ERC721, but including them in the standard, because exposing metadata through this API proved itself as a common practice for marketplaces to display NFT details. Furthermore, it’s important to be consistent within the Stellar ecosystem as SEP-41 also defines metadata as part of the core interface for fungible tokens.
- [[SEP-39](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0039.md#design-rationale)](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0039.md#design-rationale) suggests a dual approach for describing NFTs. The first one proposes an example json schema, while the other suggests leveraging the defined in SEP-1 “Stellar.toml”. While this approach makes sense for NFTs represented by Classic Stellar Assets, it can create confusion for clients. To prevent this, `token_uri()` returns an url that points to a JSON file that conforms to the "Non-Fungible Metadata JSON Schema".
