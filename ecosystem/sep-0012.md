## Abstract

This SEP defines a standard way for stellar wallets to upload KYC (or other) information to anchors that implement non-interactive SEP-6.

This SEP was made with these goals in mind:

* interoperability
* Allow a user to enter their KYC information to their wallet once and use it across many anchors without re-entering information manually
* handle the most common 80% of use cases
* handle image and binary data
* support the set of fields defined in [SEP-9](sep-0009.md)
* support authentication via [SEP-10](sep-0010.md)
* give users control over their data by supporting complete data erasure

To support this protocol an anchor acts as a server and implements the specified REST API endpoints, while a wallet implements a client that consumes the API. The goal is interoperability, so a wallet implements a single client according to the protocol, and will be able to interact with any compliant anchor. Similarly, an anchor that implements the API endpoints according to the protocol will work with any compliant wallet.

## Prerequisites

* An anchor must define the location of their `KYC_SERVER` or `TRANSFER_SERVER` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md). This is how a client app knows where to find the anchor's server. A client app will send KYC requests to the `KYC_SERVER` if it is specified, otherwise to the `TRANSFER_SERVER`.
* Anchors and clients must support [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) web authentication and use it for all SEP-12 endpoints.

## API Endpoints

* [`GET /customer`](#customer-get): Check the status of a customers info
* [`PUT /customer`](#customer-put): Idempotent upload of customer info
* [`DELETE /customer`](#customer-delete): Deletion of customer info

## Authentication

Clients should submit the JWT previously obtained from the anchor via the [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication flow. The JWT should be included in all requests as request header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

Alternatively, if the client cannot add the authorization header. The JWT should be passed as a jwt query parameter:
```
?jwt=<token>
```

## Customer GET

Checks the status of a customers information. This allows clients to check whether the customers information was accepted, rejected, or still needs more info.  Lookups are done via the stellar account ID and memo that were used for the initial PUT request.

This also provides the information needed from a KYC provider to KYC a user.  If a new account that has never been KYC'd is fetched,the server should respond with `NEEDS_INFO` and a list of all the fields the client will need to provide.

### Request

```
GET [KYC_SERVER]/customer?stellar_account_id=<public_key>&memo=<memo>
GET [KYC_SERVER]/customer?stellar_account_id=<public_key>&memo=<memo>&type=sep31-receiver
```

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | `string` | (optional) The ID of the customer, if the record was already created via a `PUT` request
`account` | `G...` string | (optional) The Stellar account ID used to identify this user
`memo` | string | (optional) Unique identifier for user being identified, necessary for custodial, multi-user accounts.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`
`type` | string | (optional) the type of action the user is being KYCd for.  See below.
`lang` | string | (optional) Defaults to `en`.  Language code specified using [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1).  Human readable descriptions, choices, and messages should be in this language.

#### ID vs. Account & Memo

The client can always use the `account`, `memo`, and `memo_type` parameters to uniquely identify a customer. However, if a `PUT /customer` request has already been made for the customer, the client may use the `id` returned
in the response instead.

#### Type specification

Different types of actions may have different kyc requirements.  The type parameter is used to signify what type of transaction this user needs to be KYC'd for.  For example, if a user is being KYC'd as a SEP31 sender, they may only require full name, but a SEP31 receiver needs to be fully KYCd with comprehensive data.  It can also be used to specify if this is a business being KYC'd or a person which can require different fields.  The value used for `type` is up to the implementor to signify the types of transactions their services support, and is optional.

### Response

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | (optional) ID of the customer, if the customer has already been created via a `PUT /customer` request.
`status` | string | Status of the customers KYC process.
`fields` | object | (optional) An object containing the fields still needed to finish KYC Process for the given KYC type
`message` | string | (optional) Human readable reason for rejection

```js
// The case when a user has been successfully KYC'd and approved
{
   "id": "d1ce2f48-3ff1-495d-9240-7a50d806cfed",
   "status": "ACCEPTED",
}
```

```js
// The case when an anchor requires info about an unknown user
{
   "status": "NEEDS_INFO",
   "fields": {
      "email_address": {
         "description": "Email address of the user",
         "type": "string"
         "optional": true
      },
      "id_type": {
         "description": "Government issued ID",
         "type": "string",
         "choices": [
            "Passport",
            "Drivers License",
            "State ID"
         ]
      },
      "photo_id_front": {
         "description": "A clear photo of the front of the government issued ID",
         "type": "binary"
      }
   }
}
```

```js
// The case when an anchor needs an existing user's email to be updated
{
   "id": "d1ce2f48-3ff1-495d-9240-7a50d806cfed",
   "status": "NEEDS_INFO",
   "fields": {
      "email_address": {
         "description": "Email address of the user",
         "type": "string"
      }
   }
}
```

```js
// The case when a user has been rejected and cannot be KYC'd
{
   "id": "d1ce2f48-3ff1-495d-9240-7a50d806cfed",
   "status": "REJECTED",
   "message": "This person is on a sanctions list"
}
```

#### Status

Status | Description
-------|------------
ACCEPTED | KYC has been accepted and user can be identified by stellar account and optional memo in future transactions.  It is possible for an accepted user to move back to another status if the KYC provider determines it needs more info at a later date, or if the user shows up on a sanctions list.
PROCESSING | KYC process is in flight and client can check again in the future to see if any further info is needed
NEEDS_INFO | More info needs to be provided to finish KYC for this user.  The `fields` entry is required in this case.
REJECTED | This users KYC has failed and will never succeed.  The `message` must be supplied in this case.

#### Fields

The fields entry is required for the `NEEDS_INFO` status.  Fields should be specified as an object with keys representing field names required, preferably from SEP-9.

Property | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | enum | The data type of the field value. Can be `string`, `binary`, `number`, or `date`
`description` | string | A user readable description of this field, especially important if this is not a SEP-9 field.
`choices` | array | (optional) An array of valid values for this field.
`optional` | boolean | (optional) A boolean whether this field is required to proceed or not. Defaults to false.

#### Errors

For invalid requests, return a 400 response describing the issue.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "unrecognized 'type' value. see valid values in the /info response"
}
```

## Customer PUT

Upload customer information to an anchor in an authenticated and idempotent fashion.

```
PUT [KYC_SERVER || TRANSFER_SERVER]/customer
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

### Request

The fields below should be placed in the request body using the `multipart/form-data` encoding.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`account` | `G...` string | The Stellar account ID to upload KYC data for
`memo` | string | (optional) Uniquely identifies individual customer in schemes where multiple wallet users share one Stellar address. If included, the KYC data will only apply to deposit/withdraw requests that include this `memo`.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`

The wallet should also transmit one or more of the fields listed in [SEP-9](./sep-0009.md), depending on what the anchor has indicated it needs.

When uploading data for fields specificed in [SEP-9](./sep-0009.md), `binary` type fields (typically files) should be submitted **after all other fields**. The reason for this is that some web servers require `binary` fields at the end so that they know when they can begin processing the request as a stream.

### Response

If the anchor received and stored the data successfully, it should respond with a `202 Accepted` HTTP status code and a response body containing the customer ID.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | `string` | An identifier for the updated or created customer

```json
{
   "id": "391fb415-c223-4608-b2f5-dd1e91e3a986"
}
```

This ID can be used in future `GET /customer` requests to retrieve the status of the customer. It may also be used in other SEPs to identify the customer.

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. The body should contain error details.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "'photo_id_front' cannot be decoded. Must be jpg or png."
}
```

## Customer DELETE

Delete all personal information that the anchor has stored about a given customer. `[account]` is the Stellar account ID (`G...`) of the customer to delete. This request must be authenticated (via [SEP-10](sep-0010.md)) as coming from the owner of the account that will be deleted.

### Request

```
DELETE [KYC_SERVER || TRANSFER_SERVER]/customer/[account]
```

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`memo` | `string` | (optional) The memo used to create the customer record
`memo_type` | `string` | (optional) The type of memo used to create the customer record

### DELETE Responses

Situation | Response
----------|---------
Success | `200 OK`
User not authenticated properly | `401 Unauthorized`
Anchor has no information on the customer | `404 Not Found`
