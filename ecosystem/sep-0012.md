## Preamble

```
SEP: 0012
Title: KYC API
Author: Interstellar
Status: Active
Created: 2018-09-11
Updated: 2021-06-24
Version 1.7.0
```

## Abstract

This SEP defines a standard way for stellar clients to upload KYC (or other) information to anchors and other services. [SEP-6](sep-0006.md) and [SEP-31](sep-0031.md) use this protocol, but it can serve as a stand-alone service as well.

This SEP was made with these goals in mind:

* interoperability
* Allow a customer to enter their KYC information to their wallet once and use it across many services without re-entering information manually
* handle the most common 80% of use cases
* handle image and binary data
* support the set of fields defined in [SEP-9](sep-0009.md)
* support authentication via [SEP-10](sep-0010.md)
* support the provision of data for [SEP-6](sep-0006.md), [SEP-24](sep-0024.md), [SEP-31](sep-0031.md), and others
* give customers control over their data by supporting complete data erasure

To support this protocol an anchor acts as a server and implements the specified REST API endpoints, while a wallet implements a client that consumes the API. The goal is interoperability, so a wallet implements a single client according to the protocol, and will be able to interact with any compliant anchor. Similarly, an anchor that implements the API endpoints according to the protocol will work with any compliant wallet.

## Prerequisites

* An anchor must define the location of their `KYC_SERVER` or `TRANSFER_SERVER` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md). This is how a client app knows where to find the anchor's server. A client app will send KYC requests to the `KYC_SERVER` if it is specified, otherwise to the `TRANSFER_SERVER`.
* Anchors and clients must support [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) web authentication and use it for all SEP-12 endpoints.

## API Endpoints

* [`GET /customer`](#customer-get): Check the status of a customers info
* [`PUT /customer`](#customer-put): Idempotent upload of customer info
* [`PUT /customer/callback`](#customer-callback-put): Set a callback for a wallet to receive status updates from the anchor
* [`PUT /customer/verification`](#customer-put-verification): Idempotent upload of data for verifying customer info
* [`DELETE /customer/[account]`](#customer-delete): Deletion of customer info
* [`POST /customer/files`](#customer-files)
* [`GET /customer/files`](#get-request)

## Authentication

Clients should submit the JWT previously obtained from the anchor via the [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication flow. The JWT should be included in all requests as request header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

Alternatively, if the client cannot add the authorization header. The JWT should be passed as a jwt query parameter:
```
?jwt=<token>
```

## Content Type

All endpoints accept in requests the following `Content-Type`s:

- `multipart/form-data`
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `application/json`

`multipart/form-data` should be used for requests including binary data type values from [SEP-9](sep-0009.md). Any of the above encoding schemes may be used when requests do not include binary data.

All endpoints respond with content type:

- `application/json`

## Customer GET

This endpoint allows clients to:

1. Fetch the fields the server requires in order to register a new customer via a `PUT /customer` request

 If the server does not have a customer registered for the parameters sent in the request, it should return the fields required in the response. The same response should be returned when no parameters are sent.

2. Check the status of a customer that may already be registered
   
 This allows clients to check whether the customers information was accepted, rejected, or still needs more info. If the server still needs more info, or the server needs updated information, it should return the fields required.

### Request

```
GET [KYC_SERVER]/customer
GET [KYC_SERVER]/customer?account=<public-key>&memo=<memo>&memo_type=<memo-type>&type=<customer-type>
GET [KYC_SERVER]/customer?id=<customer-id>
```

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | `string` | (optional) The ID of the customer as returned in the response of a previous `PUT` request. If the customer has not been registered, they do not yet have an `id`.
`account` | `G...` string | (optional) The Stellar account ID used to identify this customer. If many customers share the same Stellar account, the `memo` and `memo_type` parameters should be included as well.
`memo` | string | (optional) a [properly formatted memo](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/transactions/#memo) that uniquely identifies a customer. This value is generated by the client making the request. This parameter and `memo_type` are identical to the `PUT` request parameters of the same name.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`. If `hash`, `memo` should be base64-encoded.
`type` | string | (optional) the type of action the customer is being KYCd for.  See the [Type Specification](#type-specification) below.
`lang` | string | (optional) Defaults to `en`.  Language code specified using [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1).  Human readable descriptions, choices, and messages should be in this language.

#### ID vs. Account & Memo

The client can always use the `account`, `memo`, and `memo_type` parameters to uniquely identify a customer. However, if a `PUT /customer` request has already been made for the customer, the client may use the `id` returned in the response instead.

#### Type Specification

Different types of customers may have different KYC requirements depending on the action a given customer wants to take. The `type` parameter is used to specify the action a customer wants to make so the server can identify what information must be collected. SEP-12 does not define what `type` values are accepted and instead leaves that to the other protocols, such as [SEP-6](sep-0006.md) and [SEP-31](sep-0031.md), that use SEP-12 for the actions associated with those protocols.

For example, if a customer is being KYC'd as a SEP-31 sender, they may only require full name and email, but a SEP-31 receiver would require banking information in order to receive a direct deposit. The `type` parameter could also be used to indicate that a customer is an organization instead of a person.

Note that it is possible for the same customer to have different `status` values for different `type` parameters. For example, a customer could have an `ACCEPTED` status for the `small-transaction-amount` `type` parameter but have a `NEEDS_INFO` status for the `large-transaction-amount` type. Therefore it is recommended to always pass the `type` parameter when making requests to `GET /customer` or `PUT /customer`, even though the field is optional to accomodate for implementations that do not require `type`.

If the implementor requires the same set of fields for all customers, there is no need for the `type` parameter.

### Response

-----|------|------------
`id` | string | (optional) ID of the customer, if the customer has already been created via a `PUT /customer` request.
`status` | string | Status of the customers KYC process.
`fields` | object | (optional) An object containing the fields the anchor has not yet received for the given customer of the `type` provided in the request. Required for customers in the `NEEDS_INFO` status. See [Fields](#fields) for more detailed information.

#### Customer Statuses

Status | Description
-------|------------
ACCEPTED | All required KYC fields have been accepted and the customer has been validated for the `type` passed. It is possible for an accepted customer to move back to another status if the KYC provider determines it needs more info at a later date, or if the customer shows up on a sanctions list.
PROCESSING | KYC process is in flight and client can check again in the future to see if any further info is needed.
NEEDS_INFO | More info needs to be provided to finish KYC for this customer.  The `fields` entry is required in this case.
REJECTED | This customer's KYC has failed and will never succeed.  The `message` must be supplied in this case.

#### Fields

The fields object defines the pieces of information the anchor has not yet received for the customer. It is required for the `NEEDS_INFO` status but may be included with any status. Fields should be specified as an object with keys representing the [SEP-9](sep-0009.md) field names required.

Customers in the `ACCEPTED` status should not have any required fields present in the object, since all required fields should have already been provided.

Property | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | enum | The data type of the field value. Can be `string`, `binary`, `number`, or `date`
`description` | string | A human-readable description of this field, especially important if this is not a SEP-9 field.
`choices` | array | (optional) An array of valid values for this field.
`optional` | boolean | (optional) A boolean whether this field is required to proceed or not. Defaults to false.

#### Provided Fields

The provided fields object defines the pieces of information the anchor has received for the customer. It is not required unless one or more of provided fields require verification via [`PUT /customer/verification`](#customer-put-verification).

Property | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | enum | The data type of the field value. Can be `string`, `binary`, `number`, or `date`
`description` | string | A human-readable description of this field, especially important if this is not a SEP-9 field.
`choices` | array | (optional) An array of valid values for this field.
`optional` | boolean | (optional) A boolean whether this field is required to proceed or not. Defaults to false.
`status` | string | (optional) One of the values described in [Provided Field Statuses](#provided-field-statuses). If the server does not wish to expose which field(s) were accepted or rejected, this property can be omitted.
`error` | string | (optional) The human readable description of why the field is `REJECTED`.

#### Field Statuses

Status | Description
-------|------------
ACCEPTED | The field has been validated. When all required fields are accepted, the [Customer Status](#customer-statuses) should also be accepted.
PROCESSING | The field is being validated. The client can make [GET /customer](#customer-get) requests to check on the result of this validation in the future.
REJECTED | The field was in the `PROCESSING` status but did not pass validation. If the client may resubmit this field, the [Customer Status](#customer-statuses) should be `NEEDS_INFO`, otherwise it should be `REJECTED`.
VERIFICATION_REQUIRED | The field must be verified using the [PUT /customer/verification](#customer-put-verification) endpoint. For example, the `mobile_number` field could be placed in this status until a confirmation code is sent to the customer and passed back to the this endpoint.

#### Errors

For requests containing an `id` parameter value that does not exist or exists for a customer created by another anchor, return a `404` response.
```json
{
   "error": "customer not found for id: 7e285e7d-d984-412c-97bc-909d0e399fbf"
}
```

For invalid requests, return a `400` response describing the issue.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "unrecognized 'type' value. see valid values in the /info response"
}
```

## Customer PUT

Upload customer information to an anchor in an authenticated and idempotent fashion.

```
PUT [KYC_SERVER || TRANSFER_SERVER]/customer
```

### Request

```

```

```
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "account":"GBORFR3GDNVZ5PLUTBDQHKGWVD26CQUHORO2T3SDQ2JPLGLUJCCA5GK6",
   "memo":"21bf91a4-7db1-401d-8108-fab7660a45d6",
   "memo_type":"text",
   "type": "counterparty_organization"
}
```

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | (optional) The `id` value returned from a previous call to this endpoint. If specified, no other parameter is required.
`account` | `G...` string | (optional) The Stellar account ID to upload KYC data for. If specified, `id` should not be specified.
`memo` | string | (optional) Uniquely identifies individual customers in schemes where multiple customers share one Stellar address (ex. [SEP-31](sep-0031.md)). If included, the KYC data will only apply to all requests that include this `memo`.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`.
`type` | string | (optional) The type of the customer as defined in the [Type Specification](#type-specification).

The wallet should also transmit one or more of the fields listed in [SEP-9](./sep-0009.md), depending on what the anchor has indicated it needs.

When uploading data for fields specificed in [SEP-9](./sep-0009.md), `binary` type fields (typically files) should be submitted **after all other fields**. The reason for this is that some web servers require `binary` fields at the end so that they know when they can begin processing the request as a stream.

### Response

If the anchor received and stored the data successfully, it should respond with a `202 Accepted` or `200 Success` HTTP status code in addition to a response body containing the customer ID.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | `string` | An identifier for the updated or created customer

```json
{
   "id": "391fb415-c223-4608-b2f5-dd1e91e3a986",
}
```

The `id` can be used in future requests to retrieve the status of the customer or update the customer's information. It may also be used in other SEPs to identify the customer.

Anchors should return `404 Not Found` for requests including an `id` value that does not exist in the database. Anchors should also return `404` when the `id` specified in the request was initially used to create a customer for a different stellar account.
```json
{
   "error":  "customer with `id` not found"
}
```

All error responses should contain details under the `error` key.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "'photo_id_front' cannot be decoded. Must be jpg or png."
}
```

## Customer PUT Verification

This endpoint allows servers to accept data values, usually confirmation codes, that verify a previously provided field via `PUT /customer`, such as `mobile_number` or `email_address`. Note that while fields such as `photo_proof_residence` or `notary_approval_of_photo_id` are verifications of other fields described in [SEP-9](#sep-0009.md), the server does not require the associated fields _before_ verification can be accomplished, so this endpoint would not be useful for such fields.

Fields in the `VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` status require a request to this endpoint.


### Request

```
PUT [KYC_SERVER || TRANSFER_SERVER]/customer/verification
```

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | The ID of the customer as returned in the response of a previous `PUT` request.
`*_verification` | string | One or more SEP-9 fields appended with `_verification`.

```json
{
   "id": "391fb415-c223-4608-b2f5-dd1e91e3a986",
   "mobile_number_verification": "2735021"
}
```

### Response

Success responses should return a `200 Success` status as well as a body matching the [GET /customer](#customer-get) response schema. The field statuses for which verifications were sent must be updated to either `PROCESSING` or `ACCEPTED`.

All error responses should contain details under the `error` key. If the `id` provide is not known, a `404` status should be returned. On any other client error, use a `400` status.

```js
{
   "id": "d1ce2f48-3ff1-495d-9240-7a50d806cfed",
   "status": "ACCEPTED",
   "provided_fields": {
      "mobile_number": {
         "description": "phone number of the customer",
         "type": "string",
         "status": "ACCEPTED",
      },
   }
}
```

```json
{
   "error": "The provided confirmation code was invalid."
}
```

## Customer DELETE

Delete all personal information that the anchor has stored about a given customer. `[account]` is the Stellar account ID (`G...`) of the customer to delete. This request must be authenticated (via [SEP-10](sep-0010.md)) as coming from the owner of the account that will be deleted. If `account` does not uniquely identify an individual customer (a shared account), the client should include the `memo` and `memo_type` fields in the request body.

### Request

```
DELETE [KYC_SERVER || TRANSFER_SERVER]/customer/[account]
```

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`memo` | `string` | (optional) The memo used to create the customer record
`memo_type` | `string` | (optional) The type of memo used to create the customer record

### DELETE Responses

Situation | Response
----------|---------
Success | `200 OK`
Client not authenticated properly | `401 Unauthorized`
Anchor has no information on the customer | `404 Not Found`

## Customer callback PUT

Allow the wallet to provide a callback URL to the anchor. The provided callback URL will replace (and supercede) any previously-set callback URL for this account.

Whenever the user's `status` field changes, the anchor will issue a POST request to the callback URL. The payload of the POST request will be the same as the response of [`GET /customer`](#customer-get).

It's the wallet's responsibility to send a working callback URL to the anchor.

Anchors will submit POST requests until the user's status changes to `ACCEPTED` or `REJECTED`. If a wallet needs to watch a user's KYC status after that, it will need to set a callback again.

### Request

```
PUT [KYC_SERVER || TRANSFER_SERVER]/customer/callback
```

| Name                 | Type     | Description             |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `id`        | `string`      | (optional) The ID of the customer as returned in the response of a previous `PUT` request. If the customer has not been registered, they do not yet have an `id`.                                                                                                                                     |
| `account`   | `G...` string | (optional) The Stellar account ID used to identify this customer. If many customers share the same Stellar account, the `memo` and `memo_type` parameters should be included as well.                                                                                                                 |
`memo` | `string` | (optional) The memo used to create the customer record |
`memo_type` | `string` | (optional) The type of memo used to create the customer record |
| `url` | `string` | A callback URL that the SEP-12 server will POST to when the state of the account changes. |

### PUT Responses

| Situation                                 | Response           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Success                                   | `200 OK`           |
| Client not authenticated properly         | `401 Unauthorized` |
| Anchor has no information on the customer | `404 Not Found`    |

## Customer Files

Passing binary fields such as `photo_id_front` or `organization.photo_proof_address` in [PUT /customer](#customer-put) requests must be done using the `multipart/form-data` content type. This is acceptable in most cases, but `multipart/form-data` does not support nested data structures such as arrays or sub-objects.

This endpoint is intended to decouple requests containing binary fields from requests containing nested data structures, supported by content types such as `application/json`. This endpoint is optional and only needs to be supported if your use case requires accepting nested data structures in `PUT /customer` requests.

Once a file has been uploaded using this endpoint, it's `file_id` can be used in subsequent `PUT /customer` requests. The field name for the `file_id` should be the appropriate [SEP-9](sep-0009.md) field followed by `_file_id`. For example, if `file_abc` is returned as a `file_id` from [POST /customer/files](post-request), it can be used in a `PUT /customer` request like so:

```json
{
   "account":"GBORFR3GDNVZ5PLUTBDQHKGWVD26CQUHORO2T3SDQ2JPLGLUJCCA5GK6",
   "memo":"21bf91a4-7db1-401d-8108-fab7660a45d6",
   "memo_type":"text",
   "photo_id_front_file_id": "file_abc"
}
```

```json
{
   "id": "2f417dab-18d2-4081-8c59-c9d3afb59d3f",
   "photo_id_front_file_id": "file_abc"
}
```

### POST Request

```
POST [KYC_SERVER || TRANSFER_SERVER]/customer/files
```

Name                 | Type     | Description            
-------------------- | -------- | ----------------------
`file` | binary | A file to upload. The file should follow the specifications of [RFC 2388](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388) (which defines file transfers for the `multipart/form-data` protocol).

### POST Response

Name                 | Type     | Description            
-------------------- | -------- | ----------------------
`file_id` | string | Unique identifier for the object.
`content_type` | string | The `Content-Type` of the file.
`size` | integer | The size in bytes of the file object.
`expires_at` | [UTC ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) string | (optional) The date and time the file will be discarded by the server if not referenced by the client in a `PUT /customer` request.
`customer_id` | string | (optional) The id of the customer this file is associated with. If the customer record does not yet exist this will be `null`.

```json
{
  "file_id": "file_d3d54529-6683-4341-9b66-4ac7d7504238",
  "content_type": "image/jpeg",
  "size": 4089371,

}
```

#### File Size Limits

A [413 Payload Too Large](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413) error should be returned when a file exceeds the server's limit, defined by the implementor. A reasonable size limit is 10MB, as most smartphone photos are around 3MB.

All other error responses should use the `400 Bad Request` status and contain details under the `error` key.

```json
{
   "error": "'photo_id_front' cannot be decoded. Must be jpg or png."
}
```
