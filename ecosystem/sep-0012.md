## Abstract

This SEP defines a standard way for stellar wallets to upload KYC (or other) information to anchors who need it.

This SEP was made with these goals in mind:

* interoperability
* Allow a user to enter their KYC information once and use it across many anchors without re-entering information manually
* handle the most common 80% of use cases
* handle image and binary data
* support the set of fields defined in [SEP-9](sep-0009.md)
* support authentication via [SEP-10](sep-0010.md)
* give users control over their data by supporting complete data erasure

To support this protocol an anchor acts as a server and implements the specified REST API endpoints, while a wallet implements a client that consumes the API. The goal is interoperability, so a wallet implements a single client according to the protocol, and will be able to interact with any compliant anchor. Similarly, an anchor that implements the API endpoints according to the protocol will work with any compliant wallet.

## Prerequisites

* An anchor must define the location of their `TRANSFER_SERVER` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md). This is how a wallet knows where to find the anchor's server.
* Anchors and clients must support [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) web authentication and use it for all SEP-12 endpoints.

## API Endpoints

* [`PUT /customer`](#customer-put): Idempotent upload of customer info
* [`DELETE /customer`](#customer-delete): Idempotent upload of customer info

## Customer PUT

Upload customer information to an anchor in an authenticated and idempotent fashion.

```
PUT TRANSFER_SERVER/customer
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

### Request

The fields below should be placed in the request body using the `multipart/form-data` encoding.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`account` | `G...` string | The Stellar account ID to upload KYC data for
`jwt` | string | The JWT previously sent by the anchor via the `/jwt` endpoint via [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication
`memo` | string | (optional) Uniquely identifies individual customer in schemes where multiple wallet users share one Stellar address. If included, the KYC data will only apply to deposit/withdraw requests that include this `memo`.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`

The wallet should also transmit one or more of the fields listed in [SEP-9](./sep-0009.md), depending on what the anchor has indicated it needs.

### Response

If the anchor received and stored the data successfully, it should respond with a `202 Accepted` HTTP status code and an empty body.

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. The body should contain error details.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "'photo_id_front' cannot be decoded. Must be jpg or png."
}
```

## Customer DELETE

Delete all personal information that the anchor has stored about a given customer. `[account]` is the Stellar account ID (`G...`) of the customer to delete. This request must be authenticated (via [SEP-10](sep-0010.md)) as coming from the owner of the account that will be deleted.

### Request

```
DELETE TRANSFER_SERVER/customer/[account]
```

### DELETE Responses

Situation | Response
----------|---------
Success | `200 OK`
User not authenticated properly | `401 Unauthorized`
Anchor has no information on the customer | `404 Not Found`
