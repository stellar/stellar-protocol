```

## Simple Summary

Provides a standard way for multisig accounts to designate where transactions should be submitted for coordination of
additional signatures.

## Abstract

An account may designate which multisig server to use in a data entry that points to a server with a `stellar.toml`
file. This file contains a `MULTISIG_ENDPOINT` field which is an API where multisig transactions should be submitted.
Wallets should implement this SEP so they can support multisig accounts without requiring them to run a multisig service
themselves.

## Motivation

Currently there are only a few public tools that allow for multisig accounts, and they all do it by implementing their
own signature coordinator services to do so. Wallets or other services that do not implement their own backends have no
real way to deal with multisig accounts, so most of them just don't at all. By allowing an account to specify where they
want their multisig transactions submitted to, it enables those wallets to interop with existing multisig services
without relying on vendor-specific SDKs and APIs.

Additionally, there may be use cases where users do not want their multisig transactions broadcasted to a public
coordinator, but would still like to use existing wallets to submit them to a private coordinator.

## Specification

### Account Data

A multisig account adds a data entry with the key `config.multisig.coordinator` and the value of a hostname used to
resolve the `stellar.toml` file of the multisig service.

Example: Key: `config.multisig.coordinator` Value: `stellarguard.me`

## Multisig Server stellar.toml

Multisig coordinators advertise the existence of their service through the `stellar.toml` file. The top-level parameter
`MULTISIG_ENDPOINT` should contain a fully-qualified URL of a multisig coordination service where transactions should be
submitted.

Example of `stellar.toml`:

```
MULTISIG_ENDPOINT="https://stellarguard.me/api/transactions"
```

### Multisig Server API Endpoints

Multisig Services must expose two REST API endpoints.

#### Submit Transaction Endpoint

This is the endpoint defined in the `stellar.toml` under the `MULTISIG_ENDPOINT` key.

##### Request

}
```

#### CORS headers

In order to comply with browser cross-origin access policies, the service should provide wildcard CORS response HTTP
header. The following HTTP header must be set for the API endpoints:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

### Multisig Transaction Flow

1. Look up the data entry with the key `config.multisig.coordinator` on the transaction source account. If the entry
   does not exist on the account, do not continue with this flow.
1. Resolve the `stellar.toml` associated with the account's `config.multisig.coordinator` entry and return the
   `MULTISIG_ENDPOINT` field.
1. Convert the transaction to a SEP-0007 style URI, setting any additional parameters such as `callback`.
1. Before submitting the transaction, it should contain at least one valid signature.
1. `POST` to the `MULTISIG_ENDPOINT` endpoint with the SEP-0007 `tx` URI in the body as the parameter `uri`.
1. The service responds with a 200 HTTP status code and a JSON object specified in the Submit Transaction Endpoint
   Response section.

## Rationale

When implementing StellarGuard for the Stellar Account Viewer, it was rightly pointed out it should avoid
vendor-specific implementation. This SEP provides an alternative approach that can be used by tools that want to support
multisig accounts without implementing a multisig server for each product.

One design choice was whether to skip the `stellar.toml` step and add the fully qualified multisig server endpoint to
the account's data field. The `stellar.toml` approach affords greater flexibilty for the server to change its
implementations. It is much easier to update the `stellar.toml` than to update the data entry of every account that uses
it.

## Implementations

The server implementation is currently live on [https://test.stellarguard.me](https://test.stellarguard.me) and
[https://stellarguard.me](https://stellarguard.me).

A library that implements this protocol has been published here:
[https://github.com/stellarguard/multisig-utils](https://github.com/stellarguard/multisig-utils)

A demo using that library that submits to the StellarGuard multisig endpoint:
