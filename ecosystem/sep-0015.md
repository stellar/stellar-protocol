## Simple Summary

Sometimes there is a need to send more information about a transaction than fits in the provided memo field, for
example: KYC info, an invoice, a short note. Such data shouldn't be placed in the
[ledger](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/ledger.html) because of it's size or private nature.
Instead, you should create what we call an attachment. A Stellar attachment is simply a JSON document. The `sha-256`
hash of this attachment is included as a `memo_hash` in the transaction. The actual attachment document can be sent to
the receiver through some other channel, most likely through the receiver's [Auth server](./sep-0003.md).

## Specification

The attachment has a following structure:

```json
{
  "nonce": "<nonce>",
  "transaction": {
    "sender_info": {
      "first_name": "<first_name>",
      "middle_name": "<middle_name>",
      "last_name": "<last_name>",
      "address": "<address>",
      "city": "<city>",
      "province": "<province>",
      "country": "<country in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format>",
      "date_of_birth": "<date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format>",
      "company_name": "<company_name>"
    },
    "route": "<route>",
    "note": "<note>"
  },
  "operations": [
    {
      "sender_info": <sender_info>,
      "route": "<route>",
      "note": "<note>"
    },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

Attachments can be extended with extra information however, the should contain the following fields:

| Name                        | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nonce`                     | string    | [Nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) is a unique value. Every transaction you send should have a different value. A nonce is needed to distinguish attachments of two transactions sent with otherwise identical details. For example if you send $10 to Bob two days in a row. |
| `transaction.sender_info`   | JSON      | JSON containing KYC info of the sender. This JSON object can be extended with more fields if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `transaction.route`         | string    | The route information returned by the receiving federation server (`memo` value). Tells the receiver how to get the transaction to the ultimate recipient.                                                                                                                                            |
| `transaction.note`          | string    | A note attached to transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `operations[i]`             |           | `i`th operation data. Can be omitted if transaction has only one operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `operations[i].sender_info` | JSON      | `sender_info` for `i`th operation in the transaction. If empty, will inherit value from `transaction`.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Sending Attachments

An attachment and its hash (in a transaction) can be sent to Auth server of a receiving organization using
[Compliance protocol](./compliance-protocol.md).

### Calculating Attachment hash

To calculate the Attachment hash you need to stringify the JSON object and calculate `sha-256` hash. In Node.js:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");
const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");

hash.update(JSON.stringify(attachment));
var memoHashHex = hash.digest("hex");
```

To add the hash to your transaction use the
[`TransactionBuilder.addMemo`](http://stellar.github.io/js-stellar-base/TransactionBuilder.html#addMemo) method.

#### Example

```js
var crypto = require("crypto");

var nonce = crypto.randomBytes(16);
var attachment = {
  nonce: nonce.toString("hex"),
  transaction: {
    sender_info: {
      name: "Sherlock Holmes",
      address: "221B Baker Street",
      city: "London NW1 6XE",
      country: "UK",
      date_of_birth: "1854-01-06",
    },
  },
  operations: [
    // Operation #1: Payment for Dr. Watson
    {
      route: "watson",
      note: "Payment for helping to solve murder case",
    },
    // Operation #2: Payment for Mrs. Hudson
    {
      route: "hudson",
      note: "Rent",
    },
  ],
};

var hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");
hash.update(JSON.stringify(attachment));
var memoHashHex = hash.digest("hex");
console.log(memoHashHex);
```

## Test Cases

correctly.
