## Simple Summary

This standard describes an open REST API interface of the service that maintains
a list of well-known Stellar account addresses. 

## Motivation

Stellar address format works flawlessly as a unique account identifier, but from
the user's perspective, such long alphanumeric sequences often look
indistinguishable from one another. The address itself does not provide any
additional info about the person or entity behind it. In practice, it means that
users often can't identify the source/destination of a payment operation even in
their own transaction history.

[SEP-0001](./sep-0001.md) defines a standard way for public entities'
self-identification, which partially addresses the situation. However, not all
exchanges and other apps follow the standard. Moreover, information for many
now-defunct anchors and apps can't be retrieved since their websites don't work
anymore (stellar.toml is unavailable). The same goes for obsolete exchange
deposit accounts where people may send funds by mistake.

Custodian accounts that rely on transaction memos make another example of
entities ignoring ecosystem guidelines. Only a few exchanges adopted quite a
straightforward [SEP-0029](./sep-0029.md) standard, so the problem of missing
memos is still relevant. A systematized list of accounts tagged as
"memo-required" proved to be a convenient solution that helps to check
memo prerequisites for custodial wallets regardless of their adherence to
specifications.

While the latter two examples at least partially can be sorted out using
existing approaches given that entities behind those accounts put some efforts
into this, there is a category of addresses that will never be mapped that way.
The problem of people  loosing their money to various frauds is quite crucial â€“
law enforcement agencies often can't help in such cases.  Accounts spotted in
scam schemes or other illicit activity can be identified and blocked only as a
result of joint community effort. If the community and exchanges
agree on using Directory API to prevent transfers to/from addresses marked as
malicious, it will significantly complicate further transfers of stolen funds
while providing crucial information for compliance checks.

StellarExpert Directory aims to address the problems described above by
introducing an open REST API interface for the curated list of categorized
addresses.

## Abstract

The described curated Stellar addresses list provides publicly available
information about well-known accounts via a set of open REST API endpoints.
Address Directory API is publicly available for everyone, free of charge.

## Specification

Each directory entry contains the following set of fields:

- `address` - Stellar address of the account
- `name` - short display name
- `domain` - domain of the public entity operating the account
- `tags` - array of account tags (categories)

### REST API specification

#### `GET /directory/tags` - list all available categories

Example:

```
curl https://api.stellar.expert/explorer/directory/tags
```

```json
[
  {
    "name": "exchange",
    "description": "Centralized exchange account"
  },
  {
    "name": "anchor",
    "description": "Operational account of an anchor"
  },
  {
    "name": "issuer",
    "description": "Well known asset issuer account"
  },
  {
    "name": "wallet",
    "description": "Shared account that belongs to a wallet"
  },
  {
    "name": "custodian",
    "description": "Reserved, custodian account, or cold wallet"
  },
  {
    "name": "malicious",
    "description": "Account involved in theft/scam/spam/phishing"
  },
  {
    "name": "unsafe",
    "description": "Obsolete or potentially dangerous account"
  },
  {
    "name": "personal",
    "description": "Personal signing key or account address"
  },
  {
    "name": "sdf",
    "description": "Account under the custody of SDF"
  },
  {
    "name": "memo-required",
    "description": "Destination requires transaction memo"
  },
  {
    "name": "airdrop",
    "description": "Airdrop distribution account"
  },
  {
    "name": "obsolete-inflation-pool",
    "description": "Inflation pool distribution account (obsolete)"
  }
]
```

#### `GET /directory` - list all entries

This API endpoint follows Stellar Horizon API response format convention.
A response result contains records and navigation links.

Optional query parameters:

- `address` *{Array\<String\>}* - filters results by addresses list (up to 50 per request)
- `tag` *{Array\<String\>}* - applies a filter by tags
- `search` *{String}* - applies a full-test search filter by entry address, name, or domain
- `cursor` *{String}* - address from which to continue search
(`paging_token` value from a results set)
- `order` *{String}* - `"asc"` or `"desc"`, controls results order
- `limit` *{Number}* - data page size (10 entries per page by default)

Example:

```
curl https://api.stellar.expert/explorer/directory?limit=2
```

```json
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/explorer/directory?sort=address&order=asc&limit=2"
    },
    "prev": {
      "href": "/explorer/directory?sort=address&order=desc&cursor=GA272U6UMNKYOBDCLH5CDAPZVDG4WAGJWFY2S2RV2DN6YSSOGYECEVOF&limit=2"
    },
    "next": {
      "href": "/explorer/directory?sort=address&order=asc&cursor=GA2VRL65L3ZFEDDJ357RGI3MAOKPJZ2Z3IJTPSC24I4KDTNFSVEQURRA&limit=2"
    }
  },
  "_embedded": {
    "records": [
      {
        "address": "GA272U6UMNKYOBDCLH5CDAPZVDG4WAGJWFY2S2RV2DN6YSSOGYECEVOF",
        "paging_token": "GA272U6UMNKYOBDCLH5CDAPZVDG4WAGJWFY2S2RV2DN6YSSOGYECEVOF",
        "domain": "",
        "name": "SCAM ACCOUNT",
        "tags": [
          "malicious"
        ]
      },
      {
        "address": "GA2VRL65L3ZFEDDJ357RGI3MAOKPJZ2Z3IJTPSC24I4KDTNFSVEQURRA",
        "paging_token": "GA2VRL65L3ZFEDDJ357RGI3MAOKPJZ2Z3IJTPSC24I4KDTNFSVEQURRA",
        "domain": "stellar.org",
        "name": "SDF Escrow Jan 1 2023",
        "tags": [
          "sdf",
          "custodian"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```

```json
{
  "address": "GA5XIGA5C7QTPTWXQHY6MCJRMTRZDOSHR6EFIBNDQTCQHG262N4GGKTM",
  "name": "Kraken",
  "domain": "kraken.com",
  "tags": [
    "exchange",
    "memo-required"
  ]
}
```

### CORS, Rate Limiting and Caching Considerations

All described API endpoints have [CORS headers](https://enable-cors.org/index.html)
enabled, so they can be used directly from any website.

The effective API request rate may be a subject to rate limiting. In such cases 
the server returns [429 HTTP status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4)
error. To avoid potential problems caused by those limitations it is advised to
consider response caching or group queries on the caller side in case of heavy
API utilization.

## Design Rationale

Ecosystem wallets and anchors have been using this API since 2018 when it
was first introduced. 

In order to keep the format of returned entries as lightweight and unambiguous
as possible, Directory contains only the bare minimum of important information.
