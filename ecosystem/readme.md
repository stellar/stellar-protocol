# SEP Proposals

## SEP Status Terms
* **Archived** - A SEP that did not head towards a disposition due to a lack of consensus _and_
    support. Generally open to revival with additional edits.
* **Draft** - A SEP that is currently open for consideration and actively being discussed.
* **Pending: [Acceptance/Rejection]** - A SEP that has entered a Final Comment Period (FCP) with an
    intended disposition. After one week has passed, during which any new concerns should be
    addressed, the SEP will head towards its intended disposition [**Accepted/Rejected**] or go
    back into a Draft state.
* **Accepted** - A SEP that is intended for immediate adoption by the entire ecosystem.
* **Rejected** - A SEP that has concerns for the ecosystem to implement it in its current state.
    Generally open to revival with additional edits.
