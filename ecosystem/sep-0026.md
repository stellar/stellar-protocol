SEP: 0026
Title: Non-interactive Anchor/Wallet Asset Transfer
Authors: SDF, Fritz Ekwoge (@efritze), Ernest Mbenkum (@cameroon)
Status: Draft
Created: 2019-11-16
Updated: 2019-11-23
Version: 0.8.0
Discussion: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/484
```

## Simple Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for wallets to interact with anchors on behalf of users. This improves user experience by allowing wallets and other clients to interact with anchors directly without the user needing to leave the wallet to go to the anchor's site.

It is based on, but backwards incompatible with [SEP-0006](sep-0006.md).

There are cases where the anchor service might wish that all interactions with users happen on a different app or web service hosted by the anchor itself. For such cases, please refer to the interactive workflow found in [SEP-0024](sep-0024.md).

## Abstract

This proposal defines a standard protocol enabling the following features directly within a wallet or other Stellar client:

* Deposit external assets with an anchor
* Withdraw assets from an anchor
* Communicate deposit & withdrawal fee structure for an anchor to the user
* Handle anchor KYC needs
* Check the status of ongoing deposits or withdrawals involving the user
* View history of deposits and withdrawals involving the user

To support this protocol, an anchor acts as a server and implements the specified REST API endpoints, while a wallet implements a client that consumes the API. The goal is interoperability, so a wallet implements a single client according to the protocol, and will be able to interact with any compliant anchor. Similarly, an anchor that implements the API endpoints according to the protocol will work with any compliant wallet.

## SEP-27 Asset Information Response

[SEP-27](sep-0027.md) specifies an endpoint that provides extra information about an asset. We define our SEP-26 transfer protocols parameters inside the `transfer_protocols` field as specified in SEP-27.

## Transfer Protocol sep26

The concept of  "transfer protocols" was introduced in [SEP-27](sep-0027.md). By convention, the transfer protocol described in this document will be called `sep26`. Other transfer protocols include [`sep24`](sep-0024.md).

<details id="sep26">
<summary>
  <b>sep26</b>
</summary>

The following fields are allowed under the `sep26` object.

Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------|
`transfer_server`| url | The asset's transfer server for handling deposits, withdrawals and transaction history.

</details>

<details id="sep26.fund_wallet">
<summary>
  <b>sep26.fund_wallet</b>
</summary>

Certain anchored assets may support the ability to fund unfunded accounts. In that case, the anchor should define the `fund_wallet` field under the `sep26` field.

The following fields are allowed under `fund_wallet`:


Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------|
`enabled`| boolean | Set to true for assets that support funding of unfunded wallet accounts. Default is false if not set.
`amount_native`| number | The number of lumens the anchored asset will use to fund the wallet
`fees`| string | human readable fee structure for funding accounts.  e.g. "2 * XLM/BTC market price".
`funding_protocols`| array | An array of funding protocols the anchored asset supports. e.g. ["sep25"](sep-0025.md). For custom funding protocols that only work on specific wallets, simply use the name of your supported wallets e.g. ["sep25", "walleta", "walletb"]

</details>

<details id="sep26.deposits">
<summary>
  <b>sep26.deposits</b>
</summary>

Deposit metadata for each anchored asset is specified inside the `deposits` field

The following fields are allowed:


Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------|
`enabled`| boolean | Determines if deposits are supported or not. Wallets should consider deposits disabled if this field is not specified.
 `authentication_protocols` | array | An array of all  authentication methods supported by the anchored asset when performing deposits. An anchored asset that doesn't need any authentication protocol for deposits doesn't need to specify this field. You could for example set the value for authentication_protocols to ["sep10"], if an anchored asset supports [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication for deposits.

</details>

<details id="sep26.deposits.options">
<summary>
  <b>sep26.deposits.options</b>
</summary>

An array of objects containing all supported deposit options for the asset.

The following fields are allowed under each deposit option.


Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------|
`id`| string (required) | e.g. crypto, mobilemoney, wire
 `name` | string | Short name for the deposit option.
 `min_amount`| number | Minimum deposit amount supported by this deposit option.
 `max_amount` | number | Maximum deposit amount supported by this deposit option.
 `fee`| string/url | Human readable fee structure supported by this deposit option. e.g. "1 USD", "0.1%", "0.1% plus 0.001 BTC", "0.1%, Max: 100 USD", "https://acme.inc/ourfees"

</details>

<details id="sep26.deposits.options.fields">
<summary>
  <b>sep26.deposits.options.fields</b>
</summary>

An array of form fields supported for each deposit option.

The following fields are allowed.


Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------|
`id`| string (required) | Id of the form field. e.g. dest, email, routing_number.
 `title` | string | Title of the form field e.g. "Your Email", "Routing Number".
 `description`| string | Description of the form field.
 `optional` | boolean | Marks the form field as optional or not.
 `type`| string  | One of 'text', 'number', 'email', or 'choice'. The default form field type is text. See below on how to specify choices for the 'choice' type.

</details>

<details id="sep26.deposits.options.fields.choices">
<summary>
  <b>sep26.deposits.options.fields.choices</b>
</summary>

An array of choices for deposit form fields that have type set to  `choice`.

Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------|
`value`| string (required) | e.g. This is the value that will be sent back to the deposit  api endpoint. e.g. "bank001".
 `title` | string | Human readable title for the choice. E.g. Bank of America.

See the [BTC SEP-27 example response](#btc-example) above of an asset that uses the choice type on a withdrawal field.

</details>

<details id="sep26.withdrawals">
<summary>
  <b>sep26.withdrawals</b>
</summary>

See ["sep26.deposits"](#sep26deposits)

</details>

<details id="sep26.transaction_history">
<summary>
  <b>sep26.transaction_history</b>
</summary>

Transaction history metadata for each anchored asset is specified inside the `transaction_history` field.

The following fields are allowed:

Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------|
`enabled`| boolean | Determines if transaction history is enabled or not. Wallets should consider transaction history disabled if this field is not specified.
 `authentication_protocols` | array | An array of all  authentication methods supported by the anchored asset when querying transaction history. An anchored asset that doesn't need any authentication protocol for transaction history doesn't need to specify this field. You could for example set the value for authentication_protocols to `["sep10"]`, if an anchored asset supports [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication for transaction history.

</details>

<details id="sep26.authentication_protocols.authenticactionProtocol">
<summary>
  <b>sep26.authentication_protocols.{authenticactionProtocol}</b>
</summary>

Authentication configuration parameters for each supported authentication protocol is defined under the `authentication_protocols` field.

The fields allowed depend on each authentication protocol.

For SEP-10, you need to specify two fields:

Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------|
`authentication_server`| url | Server to use for [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication.
 `authentication_signing_key` | G... | Public key used for signing SEP-10 transactions.

</details>

## API Endpoints

* [`POST /deposit`](#deposit): required
* [`POST /withdraw`](#withdraw): required
* [`GET /transactions`](#transaction-history): optional, but recommended
* [`GET /transaction`](#single-historical-transaction): optional

## Authentication

Asset anchors that need authentication should do the relevant changes to their SEP-27 response JSON as stipulated above.

Wallets, clients and anchors should follow the authentication protocol specifications of each supported authentication protocol. For example  [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) web authentication to enable authenticated deposits, withdrawals, or transaction history lookups.

## Cross-Origin Headers

Valid CORS headers are necessary to allow web clients from other sites to use the endpoints. The following HTTP header must be set for all transfer server responses, including error responses.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## HTTPS Only

This protocol involves the transfer of value, and so HTTPS is required for all endpoints for security.  Wallets and anchors should refuse to interact with any insecure HTTP endpoints.

## Recommendations

SEP-26 lays out many options for how deposit and withdrawal can work non-interactively. These are recommendations for getting a wallet or anchor implementation working with minimal effort while providing a great user experience.

**Note:** Both wallets and anchors should implement a sandbox mode for testing that uses the Stellar testnet.

### Basic Wallet Implementation

* Identify anchors you want to support manually, and test them with your wallet to be sure they work before allowing them to be used with your wallet. We encourage you to support as many anchors as possible.
* For each anchor, use information from its [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md) file  and [SEP-27](sep-0027.md) response to display useful information to the user about the asset they've picked. Asset information obtained via SEP-27 takes precendence over the same information found in stellar.toml. This is especially true for fields that need localization.
* Provide a UI that allows users to pick an asset, anchor, and amount to use for deposit or withdraw. The UI should display the asset's fee structure (if possible) as well as information such as the address of the anchor and description of the asset from the `stellar.toml` file and SEP-27 response.
* **Use the `SEP-27` response to:**
    * Determine which anchor endpoints will require authentication
    * Fetch the asset's deposit & withdawal fee structure: show this to the user early in the process so they're fully informed.
* **Authentication**
   * If needed, perform [authentication](#authentication) via SEP-10 or any other supported authentication mechanism before hitting those endpoints
* **Make a request to `/deposit` or `/withdraw`.**
* **For `/deposit`**
    * If the issuer's `/deposit` endpoint immediately returns success:
        * display the deposit info that came back from the endpoint to the user, including fee. You're done! The user will execute the deposit exernally using the instructions if they want to.
    * Handle the [special cases](#special-cases), they're relatively common.
* **For `/withdraw`**
    * If the issuer's `/withdraw` endpoint immediately returns success:
        * Provide an interface to the user that allows them to view the withdrawal details including the computed fee. The user can confirm and then the wallet will initiate the withdrawal by sending the Stellar payment to the address provided by the issuer.
    * Some wallets might exchange currencies only once they're ready to send the withdrawal payment, so exchange rate fluctuations might require withdrawal values to slightly vary from the originally provided `amount`. Anchors are instructed to accept a variation of ±10% between the informed `amount` and the actual value sent to the anchor's Stellar account. The withdrawn amount will be adjusted accordingly.
* **Transaction history**
    * It provides a better experience for users to show deposits or withdrawals they've completed in the past via the `/transactions` endpoint, but it's not strictly necessary.

### Basic Anchor Implementation

* Decide which endpoints, if any, need to be [authenticated](#authentication).
* Pick your approach to [fees].
* **Providing transaction status**
    * Provide the `/transaction` endpoint. The wallet may rely on it to complete non-interactive withdrawals.
    * Provide the `/transactions` endpoint. Users like to see transaction histories.

## Deposit

A deposit is when a user sends an external token (BTC via Bitcoin, USD via bank transfer, etc...) to an address held by an anchor. In turn, the anchor sends an equal amount of tokens on the Stellar network (minus fees) to the user's Stellar account.

The deposit endpoint allows a wallet to get deposit information from an anchor, so a user has all the information needed to initiate a deposit. It also lets the anchor specify additional information (if desired) that the user must submit interactively to be able to deposit.

If the given account does not exist, or if the account doesn't have a trust line for that specific asset, see the [Special Cases](#special-cases) section below.


### Request

```
POST TRANSFER_SERVER/deposit
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Request Parameters:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset_code` | string | The code of the asset the user wants to deposit with the anchor. E.g.  BTC, ETH, USD, INR, etc. This should be the same asset code specified in the stellar.toml file.
`asset_issuer` | string | The issuer of the asset the user wants to deposit with the anchor.
`account` | `G...` string | The stellar account ID of the user that wants to deposit. This is where the asset token will be sent to.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) Type of memo that the anchor should attach to the Stellar payment transaction, one of `text`, `id` or `hash`.
`memo` | string | (optional) Value of memo to attach to transaction, for `hash` this should be base64-encoded.
`email_address` | string | (optional) Email address of depositor. If desired, an anchor can use this to send email updates to the user about the deposit.
`type` | string | (required) Deposit option. If the anchor supports one or multiple deposit methods (e.g. `SEPA` or `SWIFT`), the wallet should specify `type`. The type should be set to one of the deposit options defined above in the SEP-27 json response.
`wallet_name` | string | (optional) In communications / pages about the deposit, anchor should display the wallet name to the user to explain where funds are going.
`wallet_url` | string | (optional) Anchor should link to this when notifying the user that the transaction has completed.
`lang` | string | (optional) Defaults to `en`. Language code specified using [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1). `error` fields in the response should be in this language.

Example:

```
POST https://api.example.com/deposit
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

asset_code=ETH&account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI
```

### Response

There are several types of responses, depending on whether the anchor needs more information about the user, how it should be sent to the anchor, and if there are any errors.

The first response, the success response, is explained below. The other possible responses are shared with the withdrawal endpoint, and are explained in the [Deposit and Withdraw shared responses](#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) section below.

#### 1. Success: no additional information needed

Response code: `200 OK`

This is the correct response if the anchor is able to accept the deposit and needs no additional information about the user. It should also be used if the anchor requires information about the user, but the information has previously been submitted and accepted.

The response body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`how` | string | **Markdown** formatted  instructions on how to deposit the asset. In the case of most cryptocurrencies it is just an address to which the deposit should be sent to. `Important`: Wallets should make sure markdown inputs are sanitized for security purposes.
`eta` | int | (optional) Estimate of how long the deposit will take to credit in seconds.
`min_amount` | float | (optional) Minimum amount of an asset that a user can deposit.
`max_amount` | float | (optional) Maximum amount of asset that a user can deposit.
`fee` | float | (optional) Calculated fee (if any). In units of the deposited asset.
`extra_info` | array | (optional) JSON array with additional information about the deposit process. Each element in the array is formatted as follows {key: KEY, value: VALUE}. Wallets are encouraged to present extra_info in a tabular manner and enable easy copy to clipboard for each line value.

</details>

##### Special Cases
###### Stellar account does not exist

If the given Stellar `account` does not exist, on receipt of the deposit, the anchor should use `create_account` to create the account with at least enough XLM for the minimum reserve and a trust line (2.01 XLM is recommended). The anchor should take some of the asset that is sent in to pay for the XLM. The anchor should not list this minimal funding as a fee because the user still receives the value of the XLM in their account. The anchor should detect if the account has been created before returning deposit information, and adjust the `min_amount` in the response to be at least the amount needed to create the account.

Since the anchor doesn't have the user account's secret key, the user must create a trust line to the anchor's asset before the anchor can send the remaining asset tokens to the user's account. The anchor should listen for the user to establish this trust line. Once the trust line is there, the anchor should send the remaining asset tokens to the account in Stellar to complete the deposit.

If the anchor does not support creating new accounts for users and `account` doesn't exist yet, the anchor should return a `400 Bad Request` error. The response body should be a JSON object containing an `error` field that explains why the request failed.

###### Stellar account doesn't trust asset

The deposit flow can only be fulfilled if the Stellar `Account` has established a trust line for the given asset. To ensure this is accomplished, when initiating the deposit flow, `Wallet` should check if the `Account` has a trust line for the given asset. If it doesn't:

1. `Wallet` checks if `Account` has enough XLM to create a trust line. If it does, skip to step `4`.
2. If `Account` doesn't have enough XLM, `Wallet` starts listening for transactions to the given `Account`, waiting for it to have enough XLM for a trust line.
3. When asked for a deposit, `Anchor` detects if `Account` has enough XLM to create a trust line. If it doesn't, `Anchor` sends the needed amount of XLM to the `Account` for creating a trust line. `Anchor` then starts listening for trust line creations for that `Account`.
4. `Wallet` detects the arrival of XLM in the `Account`, and establishes a trust line.
5. `Anchor` detects the trust line creation in the `Account`. If the asset is `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `Anchor` approves the new trust line.
6. `Anchor` proceeds with the deposit flow.

## Withdraw

This operation allows a user to redeem an asset currently on the Stellar network for the real asset (BTC, USD, stock, etc...) via the anchor of the Stellar asset.

The withdraw endpoint allows a wallet to get withdrawal information from an anchor, so a user has all the information needed to initiate a withdrawal. It also lets the anchor specify additional information (if desired) that the user must submit interactively via a popup browser window to be able to withdraw.

### Request

```
POST TRANSFER_SERVER/withdraw
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Request parameters:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset_code` | string | Code of the asset the user wants to withdraw. This must match the asset code issued by the anchor. For example, if a user withdraws MyBTC tokens and receives BTC, the `asset_code` must be MyBTC.
`asset_issuer` | string | The issuer of the asset the user wants to deposit with the anchor.
`amount` | number | The amount the user wishes to withdraw. Some anchors may use the amount to withdraw to determine fees.
`type` | string |  Type of withdrawal. Can be: `crypto`, `bank_account`, `cash`, `mobile`, `bill_payment` or other custom values.
`dest` | string | The account that the user wants to withdraw their funds to. This can be a crypto account, a bank account number, IBAN, mobile number, or email address.
`account` | `G...` string | The stellar account ID of the user that wants to do the withdrawal. This can be used by the anchor to calculate fees based on the account. It might also be needed if the anchor requires KYC information for withdrawal. The anchor can use `account` to look up the user's KYC information.
`memo` | string | (optional) A wallet will send this to uniquely identify a user if the wallet has multiple users sharing one Stellar account. The anchor can use this along with `account` to look up the user's KYC info.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) Type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`.
`wallet_name` | string | (optional) In communications / pages about the withdrawal, anchor should display the wallet name to the user to explain where funds are coming from.
`wallet_url` | string | (optional) Anchor can show this to the user when referencing the wallet involved in the withdrawal (ex. in the anchor's transaction history).
`lang` | string | (optional) Defaults to `en`. Language code specified using [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1). `error` fields in the response should be in this language.

Example:

```
POST https://api.example.com/withdraw
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

asset_code=ETH&dest=0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe
```

### Response

There are several possible kinds of responses, depending on whether the anchor needs more information about the user, how it should be sent to the anchor, and if there are any errors.

The first response, the success response, is explained below. The other possible responses are shared with the deposit endpoint, and are explained in the [Deposit and Withdraw shared responses](#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) section directly below.

#### 1. Success: no additional information needed

Response code: `200 OK`

This is the correct response if the anchor is able to execute the withdrawal and needs no additional information about the user. It should also be used if the anchor requires information about the user, but the information has previously been submitted and accepted.

The response body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`account_id` | `G...` string | The account the user should send its token back to.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) Type of memo to attach to transaction, one of `text`, `id` or `hash`.
`memo` | string | (optional) Value of memo to attach to transaction, for `hash` this should be base64-encoded.
`eta` | int | (optional) Estimate of how long the withdrawal will take to credit in seconds.
`min_amount` | float | (optional) Minimum amount of an asset that a user can withdraw.
`max_amount` | float | (optional) Maximum amount of asset that a user can withdraw.
`fee` | float | (optional) If there is a fee for withdraw. Already calculated. In units of the withdrawn asset.
`extra_info` | array | (optional) JSON array with additional information about the withdrawal process. Each element in the array is formatted as follows {key: KEY, value: VALUE}.

## Deposit and Withdraw shared responses

### 1. Interactive customer information needed

Response code: `403 Forbidden`

An anchor that requires the user to fill out `one time` information on a webpage hosted by the anchor should use this response. This can happen in situations where the anchor needs KYC information about a user, or needs a user to agree to Terms of Service. A wallet that receives this response should open a popup browser window or embedded webview to the specified URL. The anchor must take care that the popup page displays well on a mobile device, as many wallets are phone apps.

Note that this is for **one time** information only. Please use [SEP-24](sep-0024.md) instead if you need other custom steps interactive to be performed for every deposit and withdrawal. e.g. SMS confirmation before withdrawing.


The response body must be a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | string | Always set to `interactive_customer_info_needed`.
`url` | string | URL hosted by the anchor. The wallet should show this URL to the user either as a popup or an iframe. We encourage anchors to make this url unique for each wallet, and to include a required random short-lived session id for privacy and security reasons.

<details>
<summary>
  <b>Example response</b>
</summary>

```json
{
  "type": "interactive_customer_info_needed",
  "url" : "https://api.example.com/kycflow?account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI&session_id=short_lived_random_uuid",
}
```

</details>

**`jwt` details**

Even when the user has authenticated with [SEP-0010](sep-0010.md), the wallet should NEVER pass the jwt into the interactive URL.


### 2. Customer Information Needed

Response code: `403 Forbidden`

An anchor should use this response if customer information was submitted for the `account`, but the information is either still being processed or was not accepted.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | string | Always set to `customer_info_status`.
`status` | string | Status of customer information processing. One of: `pending`, `denied`.
`more_info_url` | string | (optional) A URL the user can visit if they want more information about their account / status. We encourage anchors to make this url unique for each wallet, and to include a required random short-lived session id for privacy and security reasons.
`eta` | int | (optional) Estimated number of seconds until the customer information status will update.

If the anchor decides that more customer information is needed after receiving some information and processing it, it can respond again with a response of type `interactive_customer_info_needed`. In the case of a `denied` request, an anchor can use the `more_info_url` to explain to the user the issue with their request and give them a way to rectify it manually. A wallet should show the `more_info_url` to the user when explaining that the request was denied.

Note: this status response should never be used in the case that the user's KYC request succeeds. In that case, the anchor should respond with a deposit / withdrawal address as described by those endpoints.

<details>
<summary>
  <b>Example response</b>
</summary>

```json
{
  "type": "customer_info_status",
  "status": "denied",
  "more_info_url": "https://api.example.com/kycstatus?account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI&session_id=random_short_lived_uuid"
}
```

</details>


### 3. Authentication required

Response code: `401 Authorization`

This endpoint requires [authentication](#authentication).

```json
{
  "type": "authentication_required"
}
```

### 4. Error

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. The body should contain a string indicating the error details.  This error is in a human readable format in the language indicated in the request and is intended to be displayed by the wallet.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```


## Transaction History

The transaction history endpoint helps anchors enable a better experience for users using an external wallet. With it, wallets can display the status of deposits and withdrawals while they process and a history of past transactions with the anchor. It's only for transactions that are deposits to or withdrawals from the anchor.

```
GET TRANSFER_SERVER/transactions

</details>

Every HTTP status code other than `200 OK` will be considered an error. An empty transaction list is *not* an error. The body should contain error details.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```

## Single Historical Transaction

If the transaction cannot be found, the endpoint should return a `404 NOT FOUND` result.

Every HTTP status code other than `200 OK` will be considered an error. An empty transaction list is *not* an error. The body should contain error details.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```
