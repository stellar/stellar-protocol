## Simple Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for clients such as wallets or exchanges to create authenticated web sessions on behalf of a user who holds a Stellar account. A wallet may want to authenticate with any web service which requires a Stellar account ownership verification, for example, to upload KYC information to an anchor in an authenticated way as described in [SEP-12](sep-0012.md).

## Abstract

This protocol is a variation of mutual challenge-response, which uses Stellar transactions to encode challenges and responses.

It involves the following components:
- A **Home Domain**: a domain hosting a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) containing a `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT` (URL) and `SIGNING_KEY` (`G...`).
- A **Server**: a server providing the `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT` that implements the GET and POST operations discussed in this document. The server's domain may be the **Home Domain**, a sub-domain of the **Home Domain**, or a different domain.
    - The `SIGNING_KEY` from the **Home Domain** is the **Server Account**.
- A **Client**: the software used by the holder of the account being authenticated by the **Server**.
    - The account being authenticated is the **Client Account**.
- A **Client Domain** (optional): a domain hosting a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) containing a `SIGNING_KEY` used for [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain)
    - The `SIGNING_KEY` from this domain is the **Client Domain Account**

The discovery flow is as follows:

1. The **Client** retrieves the `stellar.toml` from the **Home Domain** in accordance with [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md).
1. The **Client** looks up the `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT` and `SIGNING_KEY` (i.e. **Server Account**) from the `stellar.toml`.

The authentication flow is as follows:

1. The **Client** requests a unique [`challenge`](#challenge) transaction from the **Server**, which is represented as specially formed Stellar transaction
1. If the request contains a `client_domain` parameter, the **Server** may fetch the **Client Domain Account** and generate the challenge transaction with an additional Manage Data operation as described in the [Response](#response) section.
1. The **Server** responds with the challenge transaction.
1. The **Client** verifies that the transaction has an invalid sequence number 0.  This is extremely important to ensure the transaction isn't malicious.
1. The **Client** verifies that the transaction is signed by the **Server Account** obtained through discovery flow.
1. The **Client** verifies that the transaction's first operation is a Manage Data operation that has its:
   1. Source account set to the **Client Account**
   1. Key set to `<home domain> auth` where the home domain is the **Home Domain**.
   1. Value set to a nonce value.
1. The **Client** verifies that if the transaction has a Manage Data operation with key `web_auth_domain` that it has:
   1. Source account set to the **Server Account**.
   1. Value set to the **Server**'s domain that the client requested the challenge from.
1. The **Client** verifies that if the transaction has other operations they are Manage Data operations that all have their source accounts set to the **Server Account**
1. If the client included a client domain in the request, and the transaction has a Manage Data operation with key `client_domain`, the **Client** obtains a signature from the **Client Domain Account** and adds it to the challenge transaction
1. The **Client** signs the transaction using the secret key(s) of the signer(s) for the **Client Account**
1. The **Client** submits the signed challenge back to the **Server** using [`token`](#token) endpoint
1. The **Server** checks that the **Client Account** exists
1. If the **Client Account** exists:
  1. The **Server** gets the signers of the **Client Account**
  1. The **Server** verifies that one or more signatures are from signers of the **Client Account**.
  1. The **Server** verifies that there is only one additional signature from the **Server Account**
  1. The **Server** verifies the weight provided by the signers of the **Client Account** meets the required threshold(s), if any
1. If the **Client Account** does not exist (optional):
  1. The **Server** verifies the signature count is two
  1. The **Server** verifies that one signature is correct for the master key of the **Client Account**
  1. The **Server** verified that the other signature is from the **Server Account**
1. If the transaction has a Manage Data operation with key `client_domain`, the **Server** verifies that the source account of the operation signed the transaction and includes an additional `client_domain` claim in the JWT included in the response
1. If the signatures check out, the **Server** responds with a [JWT](https://jwt.io) that represents the authenticated session

The flow achieves several things:

* Both **Client** and **Server** can be implemented using well-established Stellar libraries
* The **Client** can verify that the **Server** holds the secret key to the **Server Account**
* The **Server** can verify that the **Client** holds the secret key(s) to signer(s) of the **Client Account**
* The **Server** can choose its own timeout for the authenticated session
* The **Server** can choose required signing threshold(s) that must be met, if any
* The **Server** can choose to include other application-specific claims
* The **Server** can choose to authenticate Stellar accounts that do not yet exist

## Authentication Endpoint

The organization with a **Home Domain** indicates that it supports authentication via this protocol by specifying `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md) file. This is how a wallet knows where to find the **Server**. A **Server** is required to implement the following behavior for the web authentication endpoint:

* [`GET <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT>`](#challenge): request a challenge (step 1)
* [`POST <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT>`](#token): exchange a signed challenge for session JWT (step 2)

## Cross-Origin Headers

Valid CORS headers are necessary to allow web clients from other sites to use the endpoints. The following HTTP header must be set for all authentication endpoints, including error responses.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

In order for browsers-based wallets to validate the CORS headers, as [specified by W3C]( https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request), the preflight request (OPTIONS request) must be implemented in all the endpoints that support Cross-Origin.

### Challenge

This endpoint must respond with a Stellar transaction signed by the **Server Account** that has an invalid sequence number (0) and thus cannot be executed on the Stellar network. The **Client** can then sign the transaction using standard Stellar libraries and submit it to [`token`](#token) endpoint to prove that it controls the **Client Account**. This approach is compatible with hardware wallets such as Ledger. The **Client Application** must also verify the server's signature to be sure the challenge is signed by the **Server Account**, that the home domain in the first operation of the challenge is the **Home Domain**, and that the web auth domain in a subsequent operation is the **Server** domain.

#### Request

```
GET <WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT>
```

Request Parameters:

Name      | Type          | Description
----------|---------------|------------
`account` | `G...` string | The stellar account that the wallet wishes to authenticate with the **Server** 
`home_domain` | string | (optional) a **Home Domain**. Servers that generate tokens for multiple **Home Domain**s can use this parameter to identify which home domain the **Client** hopes to authenticate with. If not provided by the **Client**, the **Server** should assume a default for backwards compatibility with older **Clients**.
`client_domain` | string | (optional) a **Client Domain**. Supplied by **Clients** that intend to verify their domain in addition to the **Client Account**. See [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain). **Servers** should ignore this parameter if the **Server** does not support **Client Domain** verification, or the **Server** does not support verification for the specific **Client Domain** included in the request.

Example:

```
GET https://auth.example.com/?account=GCIBUCGPOHWMMMFPFTDWBSVHQRT4DIBJ7AD6BZJYDITBK2LCVBYW7HUQ
```

#### Response

On success the endpoint must return `200 OK` HTTP status code and a JSON object with these fields:

* `transaction`: an XDR-encoded Stellar transaction with the following:
  * source account set to the **Server Account**
  * invalid sequence number (set to 0) so the transaction cannot be run on the Stellar network
  * time bounds: `{min: now(), max: now() + 900 }` (we recommend expiration of 15 minutes to give the **Client** time to sign transaction)
  * operations:
    * `manage_data(source: client account, key: '<home domain> auth', value: random_nonce())`
      * The source account is the **Client Account**
      * The value of key is the **Home Domain**, followed by `auth`. It can be at most 64 characters.
      * The value must be 64 bytes long. It contains a 48 byte cryptographic-quality random string encoded using base64 (for a total of 64 bytes after encoding).
    * subsequent operations, order unimportant:
      * `manage_data(source: server account, key: 'web_auth_domain', value: web_auth_domain)`
        * The source account is the **Server Account**
        * The value is the **Server**'s domain. It can be at most 64 characters.
      * (optional) `manage_data(source: client domain account, key: 'client_domain', value: client_domain)`
        * The source account is the **Client Domain Account**
        * Add this operation if the server supports [Verifying the Client Domain](#verifying-the-client-domain) and the client provided a `client_domain` parameter in the request.
      * zero or more `manage_data(source: server account, ...)` reserved for future use
  * signature by the **Server Account**
* `network_passphrase`: (optional but recommended) Stellar network passphrase used by the **Server**. This allows a **Client** to verify that it's using the correct passphrase when signing and is useful for identifying when a **Client** or **Server** have been configured incorrectly.

Example:
```json
{
  "transaction": "AAAAAgAAAADIiRu2BrqqeOcP28PWCkD4D5Rjjsqh71HwvqFX+F4VXAAAAGQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAXzrUcQAAAABfOtf1AAAAAAAAAAEAAAABAAAAAEEB8rhqNa70RYjaNnF1ARE2CbL50iR9HPXST/fImJN1AAAACgAAADB0aGlzaXNhdGVzdC5zYW5kYm94LmFuY2hvci5hbmNob3Jkb21haW4uY29tIGF1dGgAAAABAAAAQGdGOFlIQm1zaGpEWEY0L0VJUFZucGVlRkxVTDY2V0tKMVBPYXZuUVVBNjBoL09XaC91M2Vvdk54WFJtSTAvQ2UAAAAAAAAAAfheFVwAAABAheKE1HjGnUCNwPbX8mz7CqotShKbA+xM2Hbjl6X0TBpEprVOUVjA6lqMJ1j62vrxn1mF3eJzsLa9s9hRofG3Ag==",

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. For example:

```json
{
   "error": "The provided account has requested too many challenges recently. Try again later."
}
```

### Token

This endpoint accepts a signed challenge transaction, validates it and responds with a session [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) authenticating the account.

The **Client** submits a challenge transaction (that was previously returned by the [`challenge`](#challenge) endpoint) as a HTTP POST request to `WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT` using one of the following formats (both should be equally supported by the server):

* Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, body: `transaction=<signed XDR (URL-encoded)>`)
* Content-Type: `application/json`, body: `{"transaction": "<signed XDR>"}`

To validate the challenge transaction the following steps are performed by the **Server**. If any of the listed steps fail, then the authentication request must be rejected — that is, treated by the **Server** as an invalid input.

* decode the received input as a base64-urlencoded XDR representation of Stellar transaction envelope;
* verify that transaction source account is equal to the **Server Account**
* verify that transaction has time bounds set, and that current time is between the minimum and maximum bounds;
* verify that transaction contains at least one operation;
* verify that transaction's first operation:
  * is a Manage Data operation
  * has a non-null source account
* verify that transaction envelope has a correct signature by the **Server Account**
* if the first operation's source account exists:
  * verify that the remaining signature count is one or more;
  * verify that remaining signatures on the transaction are signers of the **Client Account**
  * verify that remaining signatures are correct;
  * verify that remaining signatures provide weight that meets the required threshold(s), if any;
* if the first operation's source account does not exist:
  * verify that remaining signature count is one;
  * verify that remaining signature is correct for the master key of the **Client Account**
* if the transaction contains a Manage Data operation with the key `client_domain`:
  * verify that the transaction was signed by the source account of the Manage Data operation
* verify that transaction containing additional Manage Data operations have their source account set to the **Server Account**;
* verify that transaction sequenceNumber is equal to zero;

The verification process confirms that the **Client** controls the **Client Account**. Depending on your application this may mean complete signing authority, some threshold of control, or being a signer of the account. See [Verification](#verification) for examples.

Upon successful verification, **Server** responds with a session JWT, containing the following claims:

* `iss` (the principal that issued a token, [RFC7519, Section 4.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1)) — a [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)] for the issuer (`https://example.com` or `https://example.com/G...`)
* `sub` (the principal that is the subject of the JWT, [RFC7519, Section 4.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)) — the public key of the authenticating Stellar account (`G...`)
* `iat` (the time at which the JWT was issued [RFC7519, Section 4.1.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6)) — current timestamp (`1530644093`)
* `exp` (the expiration time on or after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing, [RFC7519, Section 4.1.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)) — a server can pick its own expiration period for the token (`1530730493`)
* `client_domain` - (optional) a nonstandard JWT claim containing the client home domain, included if the challenge transaction contained a `client_domain` (see [Verifying Client Application Identity](#verifying-client-application-identity))

The JWT may contain other claims specific to your application, see [RFC7519].

The **Server** should not provide more than one JWT for a specific challenge transaction.

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. For example:

```json
{
   "error": "The provided transaction is not valid"
}
```

## Verification

The verification process confirms that a **Client** controls the **Client Account**. Depending on your application this may mean complete signing authority, some threshold of control, or being a signer of the account.

An account's master key may not meet any threshold of control or could have had its weight reduced to zero. Most applications should not assume possession of the master key is possession of an account.

An account's signers may include third-party services providing services to the account holder of the **Client Account**. Authenticating accounts with less than any threshold may allow a third-party to authenticate.

An account's signers may include the **Server Account** if the server is a signer for the account. When determining the weight of the remaining sigantures the signature from the **Server Account** should be explicitly excluded. A **Server** should not assist in authentication.

The **Server** should only issue a JWT if the appropriate thresholds are met, but if a **Server** is supporting a variety of applications it may choose to use additional application specific claims to capture the threshold of control the **Client** has proven.

### Verifying Authority to Move Funds

A **Server** that needs to verify that the **Client** has authority aligned with the capability to move money out of an **Client Account** can verify that the medium threshold is met. It should do this by checking that the sum of the weights of the challenge transaction signers is equal or greater to the medium threshold.

#### Example

An anchor implementing [SEP-24] will let an authenticated **Client** define the destination of withdrawn funds. This level of control is similar to the capability to choose the destination of payments on the network which require a medium threshold.

[SEP-24]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md

### Verifying Complete Authority

A **Server** that needs to verify the **Client** has complete authority of an **Client Account** should verify that the weight of the client signatures meet the high threshold. It should do this by checking that the sum of the weights is equal or greater to the high threshold.

### Verifying Being a Signer

A **Server** may choose to issue JWTs for less than all thresholds and based on any other application specific logic. It's important to keep in mind that a Stellar account may have third-parties who are signers. Authenticating accounts with less than any threshold may allow a third-party to authenticate.

### Verifying Accounts that Do Not Exist

A **Server** that needs to support validating accounts that do not exist can require a signature of the master key of the account address for accounts that do not exist.

### Verifying the Client Domain

A web service requiring SEP-10 authentication may want to attribute each HTTP request made to it to a specific **Client** software. For example, a web service may want to offer reduced fees for the users of a specific **Client**.

In order to use this optional feature, the organization that provides the **Client** must host a [SEP-1 stellar.toml](sep-0001.md) file containing a `SIGNING_KEY` attribute (i.e. the **Client Domain Account** on the **Client Domain**). The `SIGNING_KEY` attribute must be a Stellar public key in the form of a `G` address. The secret key paired with the `SIGNING_KEY` should be protected as anyone in possession of the secret can verify the **Client Domain**.

This setup allows the **Server** to verify that the challenge returned by the **Client** is also signed with the **Client Domain Account**, proving that the **Client** is associated with the **Client Domain**. Web services requiring SEP-10 authentication can now attribute requests made with the resulting JWT to the **Client Domain** that signed the challenge.

**Servers** may chose which **Client Domains** to verify. If the **Client** requests verification of its domain but the **Server** has no use for verifying that domain, the **Server** should proceed as if the **Client** did not provide the domain in the request for the challenge transaction. If the **Server** attempts but is unable to fetch the `SIGNING_KEY` from the provided **Client Domain**, the **Server** should return a `400 Bad Request` HTTP status code.

## JWT Expiration

Servers should select an expiration time for the JWT that is appropriate for the assumptions and risk of the interactions the **Client** can perform with it. A **Client** may be in control of an account at the time the JWT is issued but they may lose control of the account through a change in signers. Expiration times that are too long increase the risk that control on the account has changed. Expiration times that are too short increase the number of times authentication must reoccur, and a user using a hardware signing device or who must complete a complex signing process could have a poor user experience.

## A convention for signatures

Signatures in Stellar involve both the secret key of the signer and the passphrase of the network. SEP-10 clients and servers must use the following convention when deciding what network passphrase to use for signing and verifying signatures in SEP-10:

- If the server is for testing purposes or interacts with the Stellar testnet, use the Stellar testnet passphrase.
- Otherwise, use the Stellar pubnet passphrase.

This convention ensures that SEP-10 clients and servers can use the same passphrase as they're using for interacting with the Stellar network. 

The client can examine the `network_passphrase` (if defined) that the server includes in its response from the challenge endpoint to be sure it's using the correct passphrase and is connecting to the server that it expected.

## JWT best practices

When generating and validating JWTs it's important to follow best practices. The IETF in the process of producing a set of best current practices when using JWTs: [IETF JWT BCP].
