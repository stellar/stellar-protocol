## Summary

This proposal defines a standard interface that tokens on Soroban powered
networks, such as the Stellar network, can implement to interoperate with
contracts that use tokens, and Stellar assets.

## Motivation

A fungible asset is a fundamental concept on blockchains. Fungible assets can
conceptually be divided into two pieces: standard functionality enabling push
and pull transfers, and varying functionality around asset administration. Most
blockchain ecosystems have very little innovation in the space of fungible
assets, with developers often relying on open source implementations such as
OpenZeppelin.

[CAP-46-6] defines a Stellar Asset contract that implements a combination of
that standard functionality, as well as functions to support behaviors that are
specialized to Stellar assets.

Tokens could implement the interface that the Stellar Asset contract defines, but it contains functions that support behaviors that are specialized to Stellar assets.

An interface is needed that is less opionated than the interface of the Stellar
Asset contract. Tokens that implement this interface would support at least the
standard functionality of tokens, without needing to support the specialized
behaviors of Stellar Assets.

An interface is needed that is a subset of the Stellar Asset contract, such that
the Stellar Asset contract would implement the interface. Tokens that implement
the interface and the Stellar Asset contract would be usable with contracts that
support the standard interface, and would be largely indistinguishable.

## Abstract

This proposal introduces a contract interface for tokens. The interface is a
subset of the Stellar Asset contract, and compatible with its descriptive and
token interfaces defined in [CAP-46-6]. The interface tries to follow an ERC-20
model.

## Specification

```rust
pub trait Interface {
    /// Returns the allowance for `spender` to transfer from `from`.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// - `from` - The address holding the balance of tokens to be drawn from.
    /// - `spender` - The address spending the tokens held by `from`.
    fn allowance(env: Env, from: Address, spender: Address) -> i128;

    /// Set the allowance by `amount` for `spender` to transfer/burn from
    /// `from`.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// - `from` - The address holding the balance of tokens to be drawn from.
    /// - `spender` - The address being authorized to spend the tokens held by
    /// `from`.
    /// - `amount` - The tokens to be made available to `spender`.
    /// - `expiration_ledger` - The ledger number where this allowance expires.
    /// Cannot be less than the current ledger number unless the amount is being
    /// set to 0.  An expired entry (where expiration_ledger < the current
    /// ledger number) should be treated as a 0 amount allowance.
    ///
    /// # Events
    ///
    /// Emits an event with topics `["approve", from: Address,
    /// spender: Address], data = [amount: i128, expiration_ledger: u32]`
    ///

    /// - data - `[amount: i128, expiration_ledger: u32]`

    /// address has no existing balance, returns 0.
    fn balance(env: Env, id: Address) -> i128;

    /// Returns the spendable balance of `id`.
    ///
    /// If the token implementation makes a portion of the balance unavailable
    /// for general use, this should return the portion that is available for
    /// withdrawal.
    ///
    /// Should always return a value that is less than or equal to the amount
    /// returned by `balance`.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///

    /// Transfer `amount` from `from` to `to`, consuming the allowance of
    /// `spender`. Authorized by spender (`spender.require_auth()`).
    ///
    /// # Arguments

    /// - `spender` - The address authorizing the transfer, and having its
    /// allowance consumed during the transfer.
    /// - `from` - The address holding the balance of tokens which will be

    fn transfer_from(env: Env, spender: Address, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128);

    /// Burn `amount` from `from`.

## Changelog

- `v0.1.0` - Initial draft based on [CAP-46-6].

## Implementations

- The [Rust soroban-sdk] contains a copy of the interface verbatim, and a
generated client for use in contracts.
- The Soroban Env contains a native implementation of the interface that is a
presentation layer on top of Stellar Assets.
