#additional notes

 The true core of stellar is it's SCP or Stellar consensus protocol. Without this there would be no stellar.
Achieved correctly I believe SCP can be a top protocol in the industry with its FBA " Federated Byzantine Agreement",
It's Quorum slicing properties, but there is still a very import an integer for the whole protocol to work and currently it is lacking this.
The fact that there is no specified communication mechanism is very unsettling to me. The closest the SCP white paper comes is a "gossip protocol"
In which is a very ineffective form of communications of data especially financial data that needs to be handled properly and safely..
This is where in 2018 I introduced a Cors Technological Protocol Upgrade, that I also licensed through MIT and copyrighted after my own due diligence..
With all the fancy math quorums and all of the alleged "Trustworthy" nodes and validators, the SCP with no real scientific means of an "encrypted" communication
Mechanism seems to question the whole Protocol... I offered them this idea in February 2018, as a developer for Stellar, through a Keybase account in which I
am Stellarspillane through a GitHub account in which I am @Spillane85.. My MIT licensed and copyrighted CORS Technological Protocol Upgrade would provide Stellar Protocol 
The viable means by which they were looking for to ensure that the trust and proof aspect of the original SCP concept stays true to itself by providing a scientific multi-layered encrypted messaging premise 
for nodes and validators and all people and all places to legitimately in real time guarantee the encryption of the data being sent, especially financial data.. With this said,
I feel the stellar protocol can be drastically improved and also make the claim that Charles Hoskinson of ADA Cardano is not the only one with a scientific algorithm, in which he feels separates his brand..
Until this gets resolved, Stellar remains Limited by its own constraints, and quite possibly without a guaranteed encrypted messaging mechanism or communication mechanism,
the people of the crypto world may choose to shy away from using Stellar as a bridge for anything.. Respectfully, Matthew C Spillane...
